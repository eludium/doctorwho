Shush.
I was being chased by a giant dinosaur, but I think I managed to give it the slip. 
Sleepy?
Bashful? Sneezy? Dopey? Grumpy.
Oh, you two. The green one and the not-green one. Or it could be the other way round, I mustn't prejudge.
Oh, you remember, er. Thingy. The, er, the not-me one. The asking questions one. Names not my area.
Well, it might be Clara. Might not be. It's a lottery.
Well, I'm not ruling it out.
Oi, big man, shut it. Oh, you've got a dinosaur too. Big woman, sorry.
(to dinosaur) I'm not flirting, by the way. 
Wrong? What's gone wrong? Have you regenerated? (to Clara) I remember you. You're Handles. You used to be a little, a little robot head, and now you. You've really let yourself go.
Reduce the frequency.
Your sonic lanterns, turn them down. You're giving her a headache. 
My lady friend. Just an expression, don't get any ideas. 
Come on, Clara. You know that I speak dinosaur.
Well, you're very similar heights. Maybe you should wear labels? Why, why are you all doing that? Why are you? You're all going dark and wobbly. Stop that.
Never mind. Everyone take five.
It doesn't make sense. Look, it's only got a bed in it. Why is there only a bed in it?
Okay, what do you do when you're awake?
So you've got a whole room for not being awake in. But what's the point? You're just missing the room. And don't look in that mirror. It's absolutely furious.
Well, of course I keep passing out. There's all these beds. Why do you keep talking like that? What's gone wrong with your accent? Why 
You sound the same. It's spreading. You all sound all English. Now you've all developed a fault.
Finally, someone who can talk properly.
Well, generally whenever anyone else starts talking. I like to skip ahead to my bits. It saves time.
What, do you want a psychic link with me? The size of my brain, it would be like dropping a piano on you.
I'll try. Brace yourself. Piano. 
I am alone. The world which shook at my feet, and the trees and the sky, have gone. And I am alone now. Alone.
The wind bites now, and the world is grey, and I am alone here. Can't see me. Doesn't see me. Can't see me.
Door. Boring. Not me.
Me.
Oi. Oi. Oi, big, sexy woman. Oi. Sorry. Sorry, it's all my fault. My time machine got stuck in your throat. It happens. I brought you along by accident. That's mostly how I meet girls, but don't worry, I promise I will get you home. I swear. Whatever it takes, I will keep you safe. You will be at home again.
Stop that. Who's doing that? No, don't do that.
Argh. Argh. Oh.
Halt. Sorry, I'm going to have to relieve you of your pet.
Shut up, I was talking to the horse.
Forwards.
Left. No, no. Right, right, right, right. Sorry, it's my new hands. I can't tell them apart.
Watch it on the corners, it's a bit slippery up here.
(sotto) Sorry, sorry. I'm sorry, sorry, sorry.
She was scared. She was scared and alone. I brought her here and look what they did.
No.
No. That is not the question. That is not where we start. 
No, no, shut up. What do you all have for brains, pudding? Look at you. Why can't I meet a decent species? Planet of the pudding brains.
A dinosaur is burning in the heart of London. Nothing left but smoke and flame. The question is, have there been any similar murders?
Look at them all, gawking.
Question two. If all the pudding brains are gawking, then what is he? 
Bitey. The air, it's bitey. It's wet, and bitey.
That's right. It's cold. It's cold, I knew it was a thing. I need um, I need clothes. I need clothes, that's what I need. And a big, long scarf. No, no, move on from that. Looked stupid. Er, have you seen this face before?
Are you sure?
It's funny, because I'm sure that I have. You know, I never know where the faces come from. They just pop up. Zap. Faces like this one. Come on, look at it, have a look, come on, look, look, look. 
Look, it's covered in lines. But I didn't do the frowning. Who frowned me this face? Do you ever look in the mirror and think I've seen that face before?
Really? When?
Oh, yes, yes, yes. Fair enough. Good point. My face is fresh on, though.
Why this one? Why did I choose this face? It's like I'm trying to tell myself something. Like I'm trying to make a point. But what is so important that I can't just tell myself what I'm thinking?
I'm not just being rhetorical here. You can join in.
What? 
Well, I don't like it either. Well, it's all right up until the eyebrows. Then it just goes haywire. Look at the eyebrows. These are attack eyebrows. You could take bottle tops off with these.
They're cross. They're crosser than the rest of my face. They're independently cross. They probably want to cede from the rest of my face and set up their own independent state of eyebrows. That's Scot. I am Scottish. I've gone Scottish?
Oh no, that's good. Oh. 
It's good I'm Scottish. I'm Scottish. I am Scottish. I can complain about things, I can really complain about things. Now, give me your coat. 
I am cold.
I'm cold. There's no point in us both being cold. Give me your coat. Give me your coat. No, wait. Shut up, shut up. Shut up. I missed something. It was here, it was here. It was. What was it I saw? What did I see?
This is what I saw. Spontaneous combustion.
I don't know, but I probably blame the English.
What's wrong? 
I know. It's everywhere.
Er, ahem, I bought it.
Er, a shop? 
Might have been a tramp.
Er, I had a watch.
It was my favourite.
Well, I was in a hurry. There was a terrible smell. 
Are you cross with me? 
I guessed that.
And if I hadn't changed my face, would you be cross?
Why? 
Well, they probably get in touch and suggest lunch. 
Well, I wouldn't like to say.
Well, I would say that that person would be an egomaniac, needy, game-player sort of person.
And I don't suppose it ever will. 
Clara, honestly, I don't want you to change. It was no bother, really. I saw your advert, I figured it out. I'm happy to play your game.
No, I didn't. 
No, look, the Impossible. That is a message from the Impossible Girl.
Ooo. 
Well, if neither of us placed that ad, who placed that ad?
This could be a trap. 
Never mind that.
Clara. 
Clara, what is happening right now in this restaurant to you and me is more important than your egomania.
Right, you actually said that. 
It's a vanity trap. You're so busy congratulating yourself on solving the puzzle, you don't notice that you're sticking your head in a noose.
What, do you have a problem with the grey ones?
Yeah, I bet you would. 
It's too short.
Sorry, it was the only one out of place. I'm sure that you would want it killed.
I'm trying to measure the air disturbance in the room.
There is something extremely wrong with everybody else in this room.
Look at them. Don't look. 
Look without looking.
Are they?
Something else they're not doing.
(sotto) Breathing.
Well, you don't want to eat, do you?
Not long.
How long can you hold your breath?
Happens all the time. 
I don't know. But don't worry, because that's not the question. The question is, what is this restaurant?
I don't know.
Er, no sausages? Do you? And there's no pictures either. Do you have a children's menu?
Any specials?
I don't like liver.
I don't think that's what's on the menu. I think we are the menu.
Excuse me. 
It's a face.
No, it's a face.
Yes, what? 
You've got to admire their efficiency.
Hello? Hello, are you the manager? I demand to speak to the manager. 
Well now, it's more a sort of automated organ collection station for the unwary diner. Sweeney Todd without the pies. 
Factually? An ancient spaceship, probably buried for centuries. Functionally? A larder.
We're alive. 
Exactly. It's cheaper than freezing us.
Are you ready? 
Don't let it roll away. 
We've got one shot at this.
Go.
Have you got it? 
Oh, it's at times like this I miss Amy. 
Nothing.
Don't miss.
Oh. 
Oh, the symbolism.
I don't want to talk about it.
Dormant.
I don't. I'm just hoping.
Well, if they're harvesting organs, a dinosaur would have some great stuff.
No, but that's a good theory. Droids harvesting spare parts. That rings a bell. 
Captain, my Captain.
Dormant. 
Yep. Oh, look. He's recharging. He's asleep. Doesn't even know we're here. 
Sure. Not sure. One or the other.
Oh. 
Look at the hands.
Look at them. 
They don't match. These hands don't belong to the same body.
Well, I don't blame you. See this, this is not your normal cyborg. This isn't a man turning himself into a robot. This is a robot turning himself into a man, piece by piece. 
Well, it would need a constant supply of spare parts. You can tan skin, but organs rot. Some of that metalwork looks Roman. Wonder how long it's been around, how much of the original is even left? The eyeballs look very fresh, though. 
It's waking up. I think. Okay, let's go.
I've seen this before. I'm missing something.
It's the brand new head, rebooting. 
I've seen this before.
Sorry, too slow. There's no point in them catching us both.
I might need it.
Ah. Hello, hello, rubbish robots from the dawn of time. Thank you for all the gratuitous information. Five foot one and crying. You never stood a chance. Stop it.
This is your power source. And feeble though it is, I can use it to blow this whole room if I see one thing that I don't like. And that includes karaoke and mime, so take no chances. See, Clara? That's how you disguise yourself as a droid.
Yeah, sorry. Well no, actually, I'm not. You're brilliant on adrenaline. And you were out of your depth, sir. Never try and control a control freak.
Yes, ma'am. 
Why did you invite us? The message, in the paper. That was you, wasn't it? Oh. 
I hate being wrong in public. Everybody forget that happened. Clara, say the word.
They never sent you in here without a word.
I've guessed already.
Oh, look. The cavalry.
What do you? Vastra?
You see? Destroy us if you will, they're still going to close your restaurant. That was going to sound better.
No, you won't. You're logical. You have restraint. You killed to survive. You're not a murderer.
And how does that make it different from any other restaurant? You weren't vegetarian the last time I checked. This is over. Killing us won't change that. What would be the point? 
You're millions of years old. It's time you knew, there isn't one.
Yeah, well, me too. I'm not going to make it either.
I've got the horrible feeling I'm going to have to kill you. I thought you might appreciate a drink first. I know I would.
Fifty first century, right? Time travelling spaceship crashed in the past. You're trying to get home the long way round.
So you keep saying. Okay, so your restaurant is made out of your old ship. But you're wasting your time. It can't ever fly. 
How? You can't patch up a spaceship with human remains. You know, this really is ringing a bell.
Okay, that's clever. How are you powering it?
SS Marie Antoinette. Out of control repair droids cannibalising human beings. I know that this is familiar, but I just can't seem to place it.
Sister ship of the Madame De Pompadour. No, not getting it.
Why don't you have a drink first? It's only human.
Neither am I.
What do you think of the view?
I don't think of it. I don't. Droids and apostrophes, I could write a book. Except you are barely a droid any more. There's more human in you than machine. So tell me, what do you think of the view?
No, it isn't. It's just far away. Everything looks too small. I prefer it down there. Everything is huge. Everything is so important. Every detail, every moment, every life clung to.
For the same reason that you're asking me that question, because you don't really want to carry on. What'll happen to the other droids when you die? You're the control node, aren't you? Presumably they'll deactivate.
There isn't any promised land. This is just. It's a superstition that you have picked up from all the humanity you've stuffed inside yourself.
You are a broom. Question. You take a broom, you replace the handle, and then later you replace the brush, and you do that over and over again. Is it still the same broom? Answer? No, of course it isn't. But you can still sweep the floor. Which is not strictly relevant, skip that last part. You have replaced every piece of yourself, mechanical and organic, time and time again. There's not a trace of the original you left. You probably can't even remember where you got that face from.
It has to. You know it does. And there's only one way out.
And murder is against mine. 
And I'm hoping you are too. This is over. Are you capable of admitting that?
Those people down there. They're never small to me. Don't make assumptions about how far I will go to protect them, because I've already come a very long way. And unlike you, I don't expect to reach the promised land.
You realise, of course, one of us is lying about our basic programming.
And I think we both know who that is.
Yes. 
Not completely entirely convinced myself. I think there should be more round things on the walls. I used to have lots of round things. I wonder where I put them? I'm the Doctor. I've lived for over two thousand years, and not all of them were good. I've made many mistakes, and it's about time that I did something about that. Clara, I'm not your boyfriend.
I never said it was your mistake.
What do you think? 
Who gave you my number? A long time ago, remember? You were given the number of a computer helpline, and you ended up phoning the Tardis. Who gave you that number?
Then there's a woman out there who's very keen that we stay together. 
How do you feel on the subject?
If you want to be.
You'd better get that. It might be your boyfriend.
So who is it? 
Is that the Doctor?
Well?
He asked you a question. Will you help me?
I wasn't. I didn't need to. That was me talking. You can't see me, can you? You look at me, and you can't see me. Have you any idea what that's like? I'm not on the phone, I'm right here, standing in front of you. Please, just, just see me.
For what?
I, I don't think that I'm a hugging person now.
Whatever you say.
Sorry. I'm sorry about that. I missed.
Glasgow, I think.
Right. Shall we, er. Do you want to go and get some coffee, or chips, or something? Or chips and coffee?
I don't have any money. 
I'm not sure that I'm the fetching sort.
You'll probably feel a bit sick. Please, don't be.
Hello, I'm the Doctor.
I materialised a time capsule exactly round you and saved your life one second before your ship exploded, but do please keep crying.
His sister didn't. You're very welcome. Put the gun down. 
Or you might shoot me. Then where will you be? 
You'd starve to death trying to find the light switch. Who are you?
No. Hey, not like that. 
No, no. Come on. Not like that. Not like that. Get it right
The Aristotle's the big fella parked in the asteroid belt, yeah? 
More or less. 
Dry your eyes, Journey Blue. Crying's for civilians. It's how we communicate with you lot. 
It's a bit more exciting when you go the other way. This isn't a battleship. Medical insignia. It's a hospital. 
I saved your little friend here, if that's in any way relevant to mention. 
You're welcome. I wish I could've done more. 
Okay.
Well 
Oh, it's a roller coaster with you, isn't it? 
Why does a hospital need a doctor?
You don't need to be liked. You've got all the guns. 
Wow! A moleculon nanoscaler.
It miniaturises living matter. What's the medical application, though? Do you use it to shrink the surgeons so they can climb inside the patients? 
Fantastic idea for a movie. Terrible idea for a proctologist. Are you going to miniaturise me? 
No, you don't understand. You can't put me in there. 
You sent me for coffee. 
Three weeks, that's a long time. 
It's not my fault, I got distracted. 
You can always find something. Come on. 
Why were you smiling? 
You were smiling at nothing. I'd almost say you were in love, but to be honest 
You're not a young woman any more. 
Well, you don't look it. 
Oh, that's right, keep your spirits up, Clara, Clara, Clara, Clara. Clara, Clara. Clara, Clara. I need something from you. I need the truth. 
I'm terrified. 
The answer to my next question, which must be honest and cold and considered, without kindness or restraint. Clara, be my pal and tell me, am I a good man? 
Neither do I. 
I need you. 
Into darkness. 
How do you know who I am? 
You didn't realise there was a living creature inside. 
Why would I do that? Why would any living creature help you? 
Die all you like. Not my problem. 
Daleks must be de. What did you just say? 
There's no such thing. 
(sigh) Do I pay you? I should give you a raise. 
Come on. 
This is gun girl. She's got a gun, and she's a girl. This is a sort of boss one. Are you the same one as before? 
I think he's probably her uncle, but I may have made that up to pass the time while they were talking. This is Clara, not my assistant. She's, er, some other word. 
Yeah, my carer. She cares so I don't have to. 
Hello again. 
A Dalek so damaged, it's turned good. Morality as malfunction. How do I resist? 
We get into its head. 
That wasn't a metaphor. 
What are those ones for? I don't need armed baby-sitters. 
Well, that's a relief. I hate baby-sitters. 
Ever microwaved a lasagne without pricking the film on top? 
Don't be lasagne. 
No, neither can I. 
You've seen nothing yet. 
Visual impulses travelling towards the brain. 
Welcome to the most dangerous place in the universe. 
Behold, the belly of the beast. 
You see all those cables? 
They're not all cables. 
Now, this is the cortex vault, a supplementary electronic brain. Memory banks, but more than that. This is what keeps the Dalek pure. 
Dalek mutants are born hating. This is what stokes the fire, extinguishes even the tiniest glimmer of kindness or compassion. Imagine the worst possible thing in the universe, then don't bother, because you're looking at it right now. This is evil refined as engineering. 
Oh, hello, Rusty. You don't mind if I call you Rusty? We're going to need to come down there with you. Medical examination, and all that. 
Well, you know, we're never going to insert a thermometer from up here. 
No. No, no, no, no! Stop, stop, stop, you idiot! 
This is a Dalek, not a machine. It's a perfect analogue of a living being, and you just hurt it. So what's going to happen now? 
Dalek antibodies. 
Nobody move Any attempt to help him, or attack those things, will identify you as a secondary source of infection. Stay still! 
Can you control your antibodies? 
Ross, swallow that. 
Trust me. 
The hoovering. 
Gotcha. 
Oh, just a spare power cell, but I can track the radiation signature. I need to know where they dump the bodies. 
He was dead already. I was saving us. Follow me and run. 
They've dumped him in here. Organic refuse disposal. We need to get in there. 
Those antibodies won't give up until we're inside there. I'd rather go in alive than dead. 
Yes, I do. Away from here. Now in. In! In! 
No, you can't. 
Pull back. Down. Jump, everyone, jump. 
People. The Daleks need protein. Occasionally, they harvest from their victims. This is a feeding tube. 
Yeah. Top layer, if you want to say a few words. 
A lot of people have died. Everything in here is dead, and do you know why that's good? 
Nothing is alive in here, so logically this is the weakest spot in the Dalek's internal security. Nobody guards the dead. Mortuaries and larders, always the easiest to break out of. Oh, I've lived a life Tell Uncle Stupid that we're in. Ah ha! A bolt hole.
Bolt hole. Actually, a hole for a bolt. Does nobody get that? 
Watch it, decontamination tubes are hot. 
Are you all right back there? It's a bit narrow, isn't it? 
Ach, your hips are fine. You're built like a man. 
What's that noise? Are you wearing a Geiger counter? 
But stronger down here, for some reason. Gimme. 
I've got it. I know what's wrong with Rusty. 
Well, you know how I said this was the most dangerous place in the universe? I was wrong. It's way more dangerous than that. 
It's poisoning the Dalek and us. Just as well we're here. 
What? What did you see? 
Stars are born every day. You've seen a million stars born. So what? 
Resistance to what? 
We're at the heart of the Dalek. 
Good. 
Well, I like a bit of pressure. Rusty, can you hear me? 
Rusty, we've found the damage. I'm sealing up the breach in your power cell. 
No more radiation poisoning. Good as new. There. Job done. 
An anti-climax once in a while is good for my hearts. Rusty? How do you feel? Rusty? Rusty? Rusty. 
Not entirely sure. 
Rusty, come on, talk to me. What's going on? 
Oh, no, no, no.
No, no, no, 
Do you see? 
Daleks don't turn good. It was just radiation affecting its brain chemistry, nothing more than that. No miracle. 
There was never a good Dalek. There was a broken Dalek and we repaired it. 
I gave it a shot. It didn't work out. It was a Dalek, what did you expect? 
What's that look for? 
Ow. Clara. 
Daleks are evil. Irreversibly so. That's what we just learned. 
All the difference in the universe, but it's impossible. 
Clara Oswald, do I really not pay you? 
Whatever you're going to do, don't do it This Dalek must not be destroyed. We can do better. 
No, I'm inside a Dalek. I'm standing where I've never been. We cannot waste this chance. It won't come again. 
Soldiers take orders. 
A Dalek is a better soldier than you will ever be. You can't win this way. 
Something better. 
The Dalek isn't just some angry blob in a Dalekanium tank. If it was, the radiation would have turned it into a raging lunatic. 
But for a moment, it wasn't. The radiation allowed it to expand its consciousness, to consider things beyond its natural terms of reference. It became good. That means a good Dalek is possible. That's what we learned today. Am I right, teach? 
But what it saw, what it felt, is still there. 
Not here. There.
Every memory recorded. Some suppressed, but all still intact. We need to show the Dalek that star being born again. Recreate that moment. You need to get up there, find that moment and reawaken it. 
Yes, you. Good idea. 
Haven't the foggiest. Do a clever thing. And then once you've done it, the Dalek will be suggestible to new ideas. It will be open again. And I will show it something that will change its mind forever 
If I can turn one Dalek, I can turn them all. I can save the future. 
I will do something amazing, I promise. 
Well, Rusty, here we are. Eye to eye. 
I saved your life, Rusty. Now I'm going to go one better. I'm going to save your soul. 
Oh, no? Imagine if you did. What then, Rusty? What would happen then? 
Your memories. I'm about to give some back to you. 
See, all those years ago, when I began
I was just running. I called myself the Doctor, but it was just a name. And then I went to Skaro. And then I met you lot and I understood who I was. The Doctor was not the Daleks. 
Oh, look. It's your memories again. It's like somebody's mucking about up there. Memories, all those memories. Do you remember the star you saw being born? 
You saw the truth, Rusty. Remember how you felt. You saw a star being born. The endless rebirth of the universe.
And you realised the truth about the Daleks 
Let me show you the truth. I've opened your mind and now I'm coming in. 
I'm part of you. My mind is in your mind. 
And isn't the universe beautiful? 
Yes, that's good. That is good. Hold on to that. 
Make it a part of you. Remember how you feel right now. Put it inside you and live by it. 
Hatred? 
No, no, no. You must see more than that, there must be more than that. 
No, there must be more than that. There must be more than that. Please. 
Of course they are. That's what you do, isn't it? 
Of course you must. You've unfinished work, haven't you? 
You looked inside me and you saw hatred. That's not victory. Victory would have been a good Dalek. 
Till the next time. 
I think you're probably nice. Underneath it all, I think you're kind and you're definitely brave. I just wish you hadn't been a soldier.
Sort of short and round-ish, but with a good personality, which is the main thing. 
Oh, good for you, still making an effort.
Okay, right, you're back in your cupboard, thirty seconds after you left. 
Oh. Soon, I expect. Or later. One of those. 
I'm sorry? 
I think you're probably an amazing teacher. 
Take a punt. 
Your choice. Wherever, whenever, anywhere in time and space. 
Try me. 
Go on. 
Robin Hood. 
Robin Hood, the heroic outlaw, who robs from the rich and gives to the poor. 
He's made up. There's no such thing. 
Old-fashioned heroes only exist in old-fashioned story books, Clara. 
Me? 
Just passing the time. Hey, what about Mars? 
The Ice Warrior Hives. 
Or the Tumescent Arrows of the Half-Light. Those girls can hold their drink.
And fracture fifteen different levels of reality simultaneously. I think I've got a Polaroid somewhere. 
Very well. 
Earth. England. Sherwood Forest. 1190AD. Ish. But you'll only be disappointed. 
No damsels in distress, no pretty castles, no such thing as Robin Hood.
A trick? 
This is not a trick. This is a Tardis. 
It's my property, that's what it is. 
You're not serious. 
And do people ever punch you in the face when you do that? 
Lucky I'm here then, isn't it? 
No. 
That is not Robin Hood. 
Nobody, sir. Not in this universe or the next. 
I have no sword. I don't need a sword. 
Because I am the Doctor. 
And this is my spoon. En garde! 
I've had some experience. Richard the Lionheart. Cyrano de Bergerac. Errol Flynn. He had the most enormous 
Ego. 
Like I said. My box. 
Well, it's realistic, I'll give you that. 
This isn't a real sandal.
(sniffs) Oh. Yes, it is. 
Sorry, sorry, sorry. Blood analysis. Oh. All those diseases. If you were real, you'd be dead in six months. 
Bye. 
Stop laughing. Why are you always doing that? Are you all simple or something? I'm going to need a sample. 
Well, they're not holograms, that much is obvious. Could be a theme park from the future. Or we might be inside a miniscope. 
A miniscope. Yes, of course. Why not? 
Or six months in your case. 
What time is it, Mister Hood? 
No, no. Time of year? What season? 
Yeah, yeah. All very poetic. But it's very green hereabouts, though, isn't it? Like I said, very sunny. 
Have you been to Nottingham? 
It's 1190. 
Right, that isn't even funny. That was bantering. I am totally against bantering. 
Because he can't be. 
When did you start believing in impossible heroes? 
I'm the Doctor. My skills as a bowman speak for themselves. I claim my reward. 
A mere bauble. 
I want something else. 
Enlightenment. 
This is getting silly. 
What are you doing? Put that down. 
I don't need saving. 
I know. 
Robot. 
Now we're getting somewhere.
He surrenders! 
Hai! 
Quickest way to find out anybody's plans, get yourself captured.
Shut it, Hoodie. I saved your life. 
Long-haired ninny versus robot killer knights? I know where I'd put my money. 
You would have been a little puff of smoke and ashes. 
You'd have been floating around in tiny little laughing bits in people's goblets. 
Oh, right, here we go. It's laughing time.
Guard! He's laughing again! You can't keep me locked up with a laughing person. 
Guards, I cannot remain in this cell. Execute me now. 
No, hang on. Execute him. 
Execute him. I'd like to see if his head keeps laughing when you chop it off! 
Yes, rolling around the floor laughing, I would pay good money to see that.
Oh. 
No, you didn't. 
Really? 
Well, you know what? I think you'll find I have a certain genetic advantage. Oh! 
It would definitely be me, though, wouldn't it? 
Yeah, of course I have a plan. 
Why him? 
Yes, I have a plan. 
Okay, let, let, let, let's hear Robin's plan first. 
Ah, so he can do the interrogating. Very wise. 
No, no, no, no. no. He will get nothing from me, because interrogation, that's where I always turn the tables. You see, that's my plan. 
No, no, chop-chop, come on. 
No.
Don't be ridiculous!
I'm sorry? 
What for? 
It's your plan. You moan. 
Why? 
I have a what? 
I'm not moaning. You moan. 
Yes, yes, I know the drill. 
No business of yours, cur.  (to Robin) Speak up. I can't hear you. 
None of your business. 
Well, if you must know, he's having a nervous breakdown. 
He's like this whenever he's in any kind of danger. He just can't seem to cope. He gets so afraid. He goes into a kind of fit. I honestly believe that he may die of sheer fright, like some tiny, shivering little mouse. Oh, God, I think he's soiled himself. 
And what will happen to the reward? 
Oh, God, I shouldn't have said that.
He carries a vital message. The Prince has promised a bounty.
An enormous one. 
Did you? That's getting into character. Okay, keys. 
No, no. I'll get them. 
I'm fine, no, no worries. I've got them! 
Well, there is a bright side. 
Clara didn't see that. 
First, a blacksmith's forge. 
No. So I can knock up an ornamental plant stand. Of course it's so we can get rid of our chains. I don't want to be manacled to you all night. 
Oh, no. Please, don't do that. 
It's not even that funny. 
Oh, don't. Can you just stop! You'll give yourself a hernia.
At last. Something real. No more fairy tales. 
A spaceship. More twenty ninth century than twelfth. Data banks, data banks, data banks. Where was this ship headed? 
The Promised Land again. Like the Half-Faced Man, but more sophisticated. It disguised itself as a twelfth century castle. 
It merges into the culture, tries to keep a low profile, so no one notices. That explains the robot knights. But the engines. The engines are damaged. They're leaking radiation into the local atmosphere, creating a temporary climate of staggering benevolence. 
I told you. It's too sunny. It's too green. And there is even an evil sheriff to oppress the locals. This explains everything, even you. 
Well, what does every oppressed peasant workforce need? The illusion of hope. Some silly story to get them through the day, lull them into docility, and keep them working. Ship's data banks. Full of every myth and legend you could hope for, including Robin Hood. 
Isn't it time you came clean with me? You're not real and you know it. Look at you. Perfect eyes, perfect teeth. Nobody has a jawline like that. You're as much a part of what is happening here as the Sheriff and his metal knights. You're a robot.
I dare. 
I would like to see you try. 
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
Very good. 
You can drop all that stuff now, Sheriff. 
He is not what you think he is. This is all play-acting. 
You're not fooling anyone, Sheriff. 
No! Clara! 
Stop pretending. You and your fancy robots. I get it. I understand. 
You and your robots plundering the surrounding countryside for all it's worth. Gold. Gold. Of course. Gold. You are creating a matrix of gold to repair the engine circuitry.
It won't work. There's not a chance. I've seen the instruments. There's been too much damage. You are stoking up a gigantic bomb! 
It's not enough. That's not enough. It'll never make orbit. 
That's the engines, building in power. Stupid, stupid Sheriff. 
Argh! Go on, give! Give, you stupid things. What are you looking at? 
That's the principle. But he's a moron. If he tries to fly this ship, it'll explode and wipe out half the country. What we need is a little riot. Time to reflect on lasers and gold. Spread the word. 
I'm afraid you're a little late. 
I'm already free! 
Everyone, the last one! 
Out, out! Everyone, quickly, get out. Quickly! 
I rather think you're the revolting one around here. I'm bantering. I'm bantering. Listen to me. You don't have enough gold content to seal the engine breach. If you try and take off, you'll wipe out half of England. 
You pudding-headed primitive, shut down the engines. What you're doing will alter the course of history. 
Listen to me. It doesn't have to end like this. Shut it all down, return Clara to me and I'll do what I can. 
Robin's one of yours.
He's one of your tin-headed puppets, just like these brutes here. 
Of course he is. He's a robot, created by your mechanical mates. 
To pacify the locals, give them false hope. He's the opiate of the masses. 
Yes! Yes, it would. Wouldn't it? Yes, that would be a rubbish idea. Why would you do that? But he can't be. He's not real. He's a legend!
Are you okay? 
Good. We don't have long. 
I know. The whole castle's about to blow. 
Run! Come on, run! 
It's never going to make it. Not enough gold. It'll never make it into orbit. Where is it? Where did it go? 
The golden arrow.
You took it? 
Golden arrow. It might just be enough gold content to get the ship into orbit and out of harm's way. 
I cheated. I made a special arrow with a homing device. 
You? You do Tae Kwon Do. That's not the same thing as this.
No, no, no, no. 
Is what true? 
I'm afraid it is. 
I'm still having a little trouble believing yours, I'm afraid. 
No. 
She should not have told you any of that. 
I'm not a hero. 
Goodbye, Robin Hood, Earl of Loxley. 
Well, I'm leaving him a present, aren't I? 
(sotto) Listen! 
Question. Why do we talk out loud when we know we're alone? (blows out candle) Conjecture. Because we know we're not. 
Evolution perfects survival skills. There are perfect hunters. 
There is perfect defence. 
Question. Why is there no such thing as perfect hiding? Answer. How would you know? Logically, if evolution were to perfect a creature whose primary skill were to hide from view, how could you know it existed? 
It could be with us every second and we would never know. How would you detect it, even sense it, except in those moments when, for no clear reason you choose to speak aloud? What would such a creature want? What would it do? Well? What would you do? 
You just have to squeeze through. 
Why do you have three mirrors? Why don't you just turn your head? 
You said you had a date. I thought I'd better hide in the bedroom in case you brought him home. Bit early, aren't you? Did it all go wrong, or is this good by your standards? 
Fine. I need you, for a thing. 
Oh, of course you can. Come on, you're free. More than usually free, in fact. 
From the date guy? It's too late. You've taken your make-up off. 
Oh, right. Well, you probably just missed a bit. Come on, come on, come on, come on. 
Yes, you know sometimes when you talk to yourself, what if you're not? 
What if it's not you you're talking to? Proposition. What if no one is ever really alone? What if every single living being has a companion, a silent passenger, a shadow? What if the prickle on the back of your neck, is the breath of something close behind you? 
Perhaps I never have. 
Well, I couldn't have written it and forgotten, could I? 
Dreams. Accounts of dreams, by different people, all through history. You see, I have a theory. 
I think everybody, at some point in their lives, has the exact same nightmare. You wake up, or you think you do, and there's someone in the dark, someone close, or you think there might be. 
So you sit up,and  turn on the light. And the room looks different at night. It ticks and creaks and breathes. And you tell yourself there's nobody there, nobody watching, nobody listening, nobody there at all. And you very nearly believe it. You really, really try and then. 
There are accounts of that dream throughout human history. Time and time again, the same dream. Now, there is a very obvious question I'm about to ask you. Do you know what it is? 
Exactly. 
I asked first. 
You really didn't. 
Why? 
Just hold on tight. If anything bites, let it. 
Tardis telepathic interface. You are now in mental contact with the Tardis, so don't think anything rude. 
It might end up on all of the screens. The Tardis is extrapolating your entire timeline, from the moment of your birth, to the moment of your death. 
I'm turning off the safeguards and navigation, slaving the Tardis to you. Focus on the dream. Focus on the details. Picture them, feel them. The Tardis will track on your subconscious and extract the relevant information. It should be able to home in on the moment in your timeline when you first had that dream. And then, we'll see. 
What's under your bed. 
Okay, now don't get distracted. Remember, you are flying a time machine. 
No, no. Don't you dare. No, don't. Don't, don't. Just ignore it. 
Okay, that's good. That worked. We're here. 
No, no, no, no, no. The date's fine. Come on. 
Your childhood. 
The West Country Children's Home. Gloucester. By the ozone level and the drains, mid-nineties. You must have been here when you had the dream. 
You've probably just forgotten. Have you seen the size of human brains? They're hilarious. Little you must be in here somewhere, with your little brain. 
It is potentially catastrophic. 
I was still talking. I needed someone to nod. Probably best for you to wait in the Tardis. 
See you in a minute. Tardis. 
We would probably have ended up in the wrong place. But don't think we have, because the time zone's right. I won't be long. 
Your door must be faulty. 
When better? Do you always work here nights? 
Do you ever end up talking to yourself? 
What about your coffee? 
Sometimes, do you put it down, and look round, and it's not there? 
Yes. Everybody. 
Who turned your telly off? 
Hmm. 
Where is he? 
I can't find him. Can you find him? 
Wally. 
He's nowhere in this book. 
Well, how would you know? Maybe you just haven't found him yet. 
Really? Well, that's a few years of my life I'll be needing back. Are you scared? The thing on the bed, whatever it is, look at it. Does it scare you? 
Well, that's good. Want to know why that's good? 
Let me tell you about scared. Your heart is beating so hard, I can feel it through your hands. There's so much blood and oxygen pumping through your brain, it's like rocket fuel. Right now, you could run faster and you could fight harder, you could jump higher than ever in your life. And you are so alert, it's like you can slow down time. What's wrong with scared? Scared is a superpower. It's your superpower. There is danger in this room and guess what? It's you. Do you feel it? Do you think he feels it? Do you think he's scared? Nah. Loser. Turn your back on him. 
Yeah, turn your back on him. Come on. You too, Clara. Clara, your back, now. 
Do it. Just do it now. Turn your back. Do it now, turn your back. Lovely view out this window. 
The deep and lovely dark. We'd never see the stars without it. Now, there are two possibilities. Possibility one, it's just one of your friends standing there, and he's playing a joke on you. Possibility two, it isn't. 
You on the bed, I'm talking to you now. Go in peace. We won't look. Just go. If all you want to do is stay hidden, it's okay. Just leave. 
Don't look round. Not yet. 
Don't look round. 
Look away! Look away now! Don't look at it! Don't look round. Don't look round. Don't look at the reflection. 
Imagine a thing that must never be seen. What would it do if you saw it? 
Neither do I. Close your eyes. 
Close your eyes. You too, Clara. Give it what it wants. Prove to it that you're not going to look at it. Make a promise. A promise you're never going to look at it. 
The breath on the back of your neck, like your hair's standing on end. That means, don't look round. 
Gone. 
Oh, the human race. You're never happy, are you? 
Nobody's safe, especially not at night in the dark, Anything can get you. And all the way up here, you're up here all alone. 
What was that for? 
People don't need to be lied to. 
Plastic army. 
Once upon a time. 
The end. Dad skills. 
Entirely possible, yes. The bigger question is, why did we end up with him, and not you? 
But why that particular boy? You don't have any. You don't have any kind of connection with him, do you?
The Tardis was slaved to your timeline. Theoretically, there should have been some connection. 
Scrambled his memory. Gave him a big old dream about being Dan the soldier man. 
Are you okay? 
It's fine. 
Really? 
Ah, Clara! Well done, you found her. Now this is really a bit strange. 
What's gone wrong with your face? It's all eyes! Why are you all eyes? Get them under control. 
This is Colonel Orson Pink, from about a hundred years in your future. 
Yeah, I laughed too. Sorry. Do you have any connection with him? 
Yes, maybe you're like a distant relative or something? 
Right. Okay. (to Orson) Er, well, do you have any old family photographs of her? You know, probably quite old and really fat-looking? 
Well, you left a trace in the Tardis telepathic circuits. I fired them up again and the Tardis brought me straight to him. So he is something to do with your timeline. 
And you'll never guess where I found him. 
The end of the road. This is it, the end of everything. The last planet. 
The Tardis isn't supposed to come this far, but some idiot turned the safeguards off. Listen. 
Nothing. There's nothing to hear. There's nothing anywhere. Not a breath, not a slither, not a click or a tick. All the clocks have stopped. This is the silence at the end of time. 
Pioneer time traveller. 
Rode the first of the great time shots. They were supposed to fire him into the middle of the next week. 
He went a bit far. 
A big bit. Look at him now. Robinson Crusoe at the end of time itself. The last man standing in the universe. I always thought that would be me. 
I know it's not a competition. Course it isn't. Still time, though. 
He's been stranded for six months, just met a time traveller. Of course he's packing. 
I just showed you, didn't I? A test flight to a restaurant. 
Easy. I can do that, can't I, Clara? 
Is she doing the all eyes thing? It's because her face is so wide. She needs three mirrors. 
We can't leave immediately, though. The Tardis needs to recharge. 
Overnight, that should do it, shouldn't it, Clara? 
One more night. That's, that's not a problem, is it? 
It's a shame, isn't it? 
There's only three people left in the universe, and you're lying to the other two. It was the first thing I noticed when I stepped in here. You must have seen it, too, Clara. You've got eyes out to here.
The universe is dead. Everything that ever was is dead and gone. There's nothing beyond this door but nothingness for ever. So why is it locked? 
Afraid of the dark? But the dark is empty now. 
Waiting. 
That's one way of looking at it. 
That's a hell of a lot of ghosts. 
It's always been there. It's only visible in the night lights. 
Colonel Pink. Apparently, at night, he needs a reminder. Six months stranded alone, I suppose it must be tempting. 
Company. 
What kind of explanation would you like? 
Well, the systems are switching to low power. There are temperature differentials all over this ship. It's like pipes banging when the heating goes off. 
Me, too. Who were you having dinner with? 
I thought that I would give it a try. 
Serious? 
A serious date? 
Well, I would like to know about his prospects. If you like, I can pop ahead and check them out. 
Atmospheric pressure equalising 
Company. 
Because I need to know. 
Suppose that there are creatures that live to hide. That only show themselves to the very young or the very old, or the mad, or anyone who wouldn't be believed. 
What would those creatures do when everyone was gone? When there was only one man left standing in the universe? 
Potentially, the hull cooling. 
Believably. 
Someone knocking. 
Yes. 
What's that in the mirror, or the corner of your eye? What's that footstep following, but never passing by? 
No. Get in the Tardis. 
I have to know. 
The Tardis, now! 
It's a pressure lock. Releasing it could've triggered the opening mechanism. 
There is an air shell round the ship. Why are you still here? 
Then you will never travel with me again, because that is the deal! Tardis, now! Do as you are told! 
I know. 
Perhaps they're all just waiting, perhaps when we're all dead, out they'll come a-slithering from underneath the bed. 
Sontarans! Perverting the course of human history! 
You're confusing me. What? Shut up, shut up. Where's Clara?
Where are we? Have we moved? Where have we landed? 
Why? 
I don't take orders, Clara. 
No, no. Not the hugging. No, no, no. I'm against the hugging. Please. 
The Satanic Nebula. 
Or the lagoon of lost stars. Or we could go to Brighton. I've got a whole day worked out. 
Have you? 
Yeah, okay. 
Yep, looking. 
Why is your face all coloured in? 
Are you taller? 
What, do you have to reach a high shelf? 
For a shelf? 
Hardly anyone in the universe has that number. 
Yes, from some woman in a shop. We still don't know who that was. 
There are very few people that it could be. 
Why not? 
What? 
Huh. It's just a phone, Clara. Nothing happens when you answer the phone. 
Don't touch it. 
It's a memory worm. 
Deletes your memories. 
The same way we all did, but we've all forgotten. 
What are you doing? 
Ah. Augmented. Nice. 
Okay, okay, okay. Stop, stop, stop. Far enough. Augmented human. Computer augmented, yes? Mainframe in your head? 
You're a liar. That's a prison code on your neck. 
Good. This is a good day to be a bank robber. Mutant human. What kind of mutant? 
It's my special power. What's yours? 
Human cells. DNA from a customer, maybe? A disguise to get us in? 
I don't think we have a choice. We've already agreed to. 
How long can you maintain the image for? 
Question one. Robbing banks is easy if you've got a Tardis. So why am I not using it? 
Okay, that probably should be question one. 
I don't know. Hate not knowing. 
Interesting. 
The latest thing in sniffer dogs. Telepathic. It hunts guilt. 
Currently being drowned out. 
If he has a plan, he's trying not to think of it. 
It's wiping his mind. Turning his brain into soup. 
He's gone already. It's over. 
Those aren't tears, Clara. That's soup. 
Depends what the thing is. 
Okay, well, I'm no expert, but fuses, timer. I'm going to stick my neck out and say bomb. (to Psi) Bank schematic. Now. 
The floor below is all service corridors, the veins and arteries of the bank. 
He wants us to blow through the floor. 
Well, not necessarily. There must be a plan. 
Oh, don't be so pessimistic. It'll affect team morale. 
Well, only very, very briefly. 
What do you want, Psi, more than anything else? Whatever it is, it's in this bank. You agreed to rob the most impregnable bank in history. You must have had a very good reason. We all must have. Picture the thing you want most in the universe, and decide how badly you want it. Well? 
Basically, it's the eyebrows. 
Nice. Dimensional shift bomb. Sends the particles to a different plane. Come on then, Team Not Dead. 
I don't know. The Architect set all this up. It should make sense. My personal plan is that a thing will probably happen quite soon. 
Yep. 
A thing. Probably. 
There you go. Thing time. 
By breaking into the bank in advance of breaking into the bank. 
Not our problem. 
Guilt is our problem. Guilt, in this bank, is fatal. The Teller can hear it. Ever since that first case was opened, we've been targets. The more we know about why we're here, the louder our guilt screams. That's why we wiped our memories. For our own safety. Now, once I open this, I can't close it again. 
I'm waiting for you to volunteer. 
Because you didn't need that memory worm, did you? You're half-computer. You can perform a manual delete. You can clear your thoughts. 
Not a clue. 
What is? 
Interface with this. 
Well, why not? There's no immediate threat. 
I should stop saying things like that. 
Clara, you stay with Psi. Saibra, let's go and investigate. 
Aren't you going to ask me? 
Exit strategy of sorts. How did you know I was lying? 
Quite a gift. 
It got us in here. 
Why? 
I don't know. But someone is watching. 
Now this says place to hide.
Nobody move. Nobody say a word. It's cocooned. Forced hibernation. Its power is probably dormant. 
Clara. It's locked on to you. It may still be asleep. Don't wake it. 
Keep your mind blank. Block everything. Once it locks onto your thoughts, it won't let go. 
It's waking up. Keep blocking your thoughts, Clara. Don't think. 
It's scanning her brain. 
Soup. 
Saibra. 
It's rooting through your brain. It's tasting all the secrets stashed inside. Any moment now, it will finish its sweep and start feasting on what's left. 
Yes. 
I'm sorry. I don't know how, once it's locked onto your thoughts. 
Atomic shredder. 
And instant. 
I hate him, but I can't make that promise. 
Right, vault. That's clear. What's not clear is what we do now. 
No, I'm an amnesiac robbing a bank. Why would I be okay? 
What? Saibra is dead, we are alive. Prioritise if you want to stay that way. 
Listen. When we're done here, by all means, you go and find yourself a shoulder to cry on. You'll probably need that. Till then, what you need is me. 
Another gift from the Architect. Shall we unwrap it? 
Psi, how long? 
It's locked on to one of our thought trails. We have to split up, minimise the brain signals. 
Separate. 
Clara! 
Multiple locks. Last one still in place. 
Atomic seal. Unbreakable, even for me. The Architect would know that. He wouldn't bring us all this way for nothing. 
Exactly. There must be some logic. 
Come on, Architect. What else have you got? 
A storm. The storm's tripping the system. That's what he's got, a storm. 
(laughs) Of course. Stupid, stupid Doctor. Of course, of course. 
Whoever planned all this, they're in the future. This isn't just a bank heist, it's a time travel heist. We've been sent back in time to the exact moment of the storm, to be in exactly the right place when it hits, because that's the only time the bank is vulnerable. 
The bank is now open. 
Come on.
It explains why we're not here in the Tardis. 
The solar disruption would have made navigation impossible. The one time the bank is vulnerable is the one time we can't just land. 
Technology. 251. Find it. 
It's a neophyte circuit. (It lights up blue.) I've only ever seen one once before. It can reboot any system, replace any lost data. 
So what did Saibra come for? 
Gene suppressant. 
Everyone has a weakness. So the big question is this. What did we come for? 
Private vault. Karabraxos's own fortune? 
Useful species. 
Must be noisy inside its head. Painful to listen to so much chatter, so many secrets. Must drive it wild. How can you force it to obey? 
You're scared. 
If you don't like your boss, why stay? 
Don't do this. I'm having a very bad day, and I do not want to be pushed around. 
Wrong? 
Why are you undoing my handcuffs? 
Saibra? 
No, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait. What? Sorry, sorry, what? You, you, you're, you're alive? 
No, no, no, no. Not dead. Alive. 
Well, this is good, I suppose. You'll be able to resume the mission. Gene suppressant. Antidote for your condition. 
Memory giver. All your yesterdays. 
There you go. Job done, paid in full. Clever old Architect. 
I still hate him. 
I don't know. There's something in the private vault. 
What's that? 
Someone likes to hang out with their wealth. 
Director Karabraxos? Excuse us, but we've come to rob you. So if you want to put your hands above your head, or 
You're Karabraxos? 
She's a clone. 
She hates her own clones. She burns her own clones. Frankly, you're a career break for the right therapist. Shut up. Everybody, just, just shut up. 
Shut up. Just shut up, shut up, shut up, shutetty up up up. What, what did you say? What did you say? What did you say about your own eyes? De-shut up. Say it again.  SAIBRA: How can you trust someone if they look back at you out of your own eyes? 
I know one thing about the Architect. What is it that I know about the Architect? I know one thing. Something that I've known from the very start. 
I hate him. He's overbearing, he's manipulative, he likes to think that he's very clever. I hate him! Clara, don't you see?
I hate the Architect. 
We're getting sanity judgment from the self-burner. Do you mind if I borrow a little bit of paper? 
I'm giving you my telephone number. 
Well, I thought you might like to call me someday. 
Sorry, I thought we were getting along famously. Am I, like, misreading the signals or something? 
Oh, that was a big one, wasn't it? I think that your bank is about to close for good, Karabraxos. If I was you, I'd get going. Don't mind us, we'll just stay here and burn. 
Hard to know what to take. The greatest treasures of the universe in just one suitcase. 
They're not shredders, they're teleports, and that's not the most interesting thing about them. 
There were six of them. Hey. Give me a call me some time. 
Yeah, you'll be old. We'll get on famously. You'll be old and full of regret for the things that you can't change. 
No, not a thing. But I'm understanding. 
I'm not sure yet. I need my memory back. And I think there's only one way to do that. 
Soup. 
Hello, big man. Peckish? 
No, no. Let it take me. Let it read me. It's the only way. 
What have I told you about pessimism? That's it, that's it. There are so many memories in here. Feast on them. Tuck in. Big scarf, bow tie, bit embarrassing. What do you think of the new look? I was hoping for minimalism, but I think I came up with magician. In the last few days, there's been a block. Can you see the block? Tell me why I'm here. Show me why I'm here. Show me! 
It's just a phone, Clara. Nothing happens when you answer the phone. 
Hello? 
It's a little detour. It's a, it's a job, I've got to do it for someone. Come on. 
We need to rob a bank. 
Clara, I need worms. 
The Bank of Karabraxos has never been breached. 
Architect. 
Architect. 
Architect. 
Architect. 
You will rob the Bank of Karabraxos. 
Did you see why we came? Why we're here? We had to delete our own memories, otherwise you'd have known, and then she'd have known, because you were mentally linked. But she's gone now. They've all gone. They have no power over you now. You can do exactly what you want to do now. Exactly what you've always wanted to do. 
Of course it does. It was linked to Karabraxos. 
Well so might you do, to protect everything you loved. 
There she is. Not the last of its species. The last two. 
It's okay, it's okay. It's all right. 
Exactly. This wasn't a bank heist. It never was. It was rescue mission for a whole species. Flesh and blood, the last currency. 
Time to go home. What do you think of that, big man? 
So much mental traffic in the universe. Solitude is the only peace. 
Gioffre Borgia, mucho scary hombre, says to me, what do you think of our Leaning Tower of Pisa? I say, (leans sideways) it looks okay to me. 
Yeah. I kind of miss that. 
7.12, local time, as promised. Go and enjoy yourself. Don't do anything I wouldn't do. 
Don't worry. Calories consumed on the Tardis have no lasting effect. 
Of course I'm kidding. It's a time machine, not a miracle worker. Bye, bye. 
Don't rob any banks what? 
Course not, boss. 
Robbing a bank. Robbing a whole bank. Beat that for a date.
Pass me the vibro-cutters. 
Come on then, pass them to me. 
Why have you got two jackets? Is one of them faulty? 
Of course we won't starve. The sand piranhas will get us long before that. 
Fish people. 
Fish. And people. Come and see. 
Tardis has got to be round this corner. I hate soldiers. Don't you hate soldiers? 
Just keep running! 
Clara, you, you look lovely today. Have you had a wash? 
Because it works on you. Listen, I'm sorry but there's going to be no trip today. I'm sorry. Er, I've got to do a thing. It might take a while. 
Just a thing. 
I'm a man of mystery. 
Undercover. Deep cover. 
What do you mean?
Of course I can do deep cover. 
I'll see you when I see you. 
When I see you. 
Excellent. I was meaning to bring it up. 
I'm the new caretaker. John Smith. 
Thanks. Yes, John Smith's the name. But, you know, here's a thing. Most people just call me the Doctor. 
So, if anybody needs me, just, you know, give me a shout. I'll be in the storeroom just getting the lie of the land. 
Yes, no body's taking any notice at all. Absolutely good news because it means I must be coming across just as an absolutely boring human being like you. 
Deep cover. Deep cover. 
So, you recognised me, then. 
But you saw straight through that. 
He's fine. Hypnotised. He thinks he's got the 'flu. Also a flying car and three wives. It's going to be a rude awakening. 
It's assembly. You'd better get going. Go and worship something. 
Listen, it's lovely talking to you, but I've really got to get on. I'm a caretaker now. Look, I've got a brush. 
Yes, me. Now, go. The walls need sponging and there's a sinister puddle. 
I lived among otters once for a month. Well, I sulked. River and I, we had this big fight 
Exactly. It'll be even easier. 
No. Nobody is safe. But soon the answer will be yes, everybody is safe, if you let me get on. Now, pretend you don't know me. Stay out of my way. The less you know, the better. I'll explain it all later. Go and sing with the otters. 
That's fine. That's a perfectly normal reaction. 
Wrong. 
On the board. Wrong. Wrong. 
Just taking care. 
Jane Austen wrote Pride and Prejudice in 1796. 
Not in 1797, because she didn't have the time. She was so busy doing all
No, I read the book. There's a bio at the back. 
Boggons? 
I'm sure I won't need you, Sergeant. Fully qualified. (sparks) You best get back to your PE class. 
Do you? What, in emergencies? 
How does that work? What if the kids have questions? 
Maths. 
But he said you were a soldier. 
But what about all the PE? 
Sorry, that seems very unlikely. 
Yes, you better run along, Sergeant. That ball isn't going to kick itself, is it? 
Nope, sorry. No, I can't retain that. I've tried. It's just not going in. 
Yeah. The colour. 
Oh, yeah. Okay, yeah. Same name, doesn't look anything like him though. 
Does he? I don't know. Who remembers a PE teacher? 
So, is he here then? 
The one that you keep going on serious dates with. 
I promise I won't. I'm being nice. 
Oh, I see. 
Nothing. Nothing at all. 
Yes, yes, no, of course, of course, yes. Don't mind this old man. You two kids just pop off together. 
I'm a caretaker. Don't mind me. 
(sotto) Oh, Clara. 
What does that mean? Kids. What's the matter with kids today? 
And one for luck.
Okay. Now we're in business. Let's see the lie of the land. Time to see what's going on. 
Can't you read? 
The door. It says, Keep Out. 
Oh, so it does. Never lose your temper in the middle of a door sign. 
The caretaker's box. Every caretaker has their own box. 
Exactly, there's a policeman in there, in case of emergencies and children. Towels, there, g-g-go. 
Of course there was. What's a policeman without a death ray? 
Oh, listen, there's the bell. Off you go. Haven't you got shoplifting to go to? 
Oh, yes, fine. Well, cut along, you're running out of time. 
Everything. Human beings have incredibly short life spans. Frankly, you should all be in a permanent state of panic. Tick tock, tick tock. 
Yes, I am. What about you? 
Good to meet you. 
Now get lost. 
Paper towels. Now, I imagine you have many questions. Fire away. I won't answer any of them. 
What were who like? 
Well, it's lucky I'm here, then. 
Me? 
You don't know that. 
It's a scanner. I'm scanning. Why do I keep you around? 
Any alien technology in this vicinity should show up. I used to have a teacher exactly like you once. 
A Skovox Blitzer. One of the deadliest killing machines ever created. Probably homed in here because of artron emissions. You've had enough of them in this area over the years. There's enough explosive in its armoury to take out the whole planet. 
Sooner or later it will creep from its hidey-hole and some military idiot will try to attack it. 
The world is full of PE teachers. 
This is a very special watch. 
So, I give the Blitzer a tiny whiff of non-threatening alien tech, I lead it back here, but I don't want it to scan me, hence invisible. 
My school? Oh, that is telling. This is the only suitably empty place in the area. I've set up a circle of time mines around the school. Chronodyne generators. Bit unstable. 
I switch them on, the Blitzer gets sucked into a big old time vortex, billions of years into the future. It's dead easy. Tiny bit boring. I'll need a book and a sandwich. 
I don't need you this time. I'll see you tomorrow. We'll go somewhere nice. Ancient Egypt. Crocodilopolis. They worship a big crocodile there, so the name is a useful coincidence. Go and canoodle with your boyfriend. Come on. I wasn't born yesterday. Far from it. 
Possibly reminded me of a certain dashing young time traveller. 
It's easily done. There's a lot to estimate. 
Yes, I like him very, very much. Go home and canoodle. Doctor's orders. Come on. 
Oh, sing hosanna. 
And we're off. 
Home, sweet home. 
What? Red? Red. No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no! 
Listen. I'm unarmed. I'm peaceful. Don't you understand? I, I know that you shouldn't be on this planet but I can help you with that. I
Get back! 
(sarcastic) Oh, oh, well done, PE, brilliant work. What's this? A chronodyne generator? I'll just deactivate that, shall I? I've got a swimming certificate so that qualifies me to meddle with higher technology. Never mind that some people are actually trying to save the planet. Oh, no. There's only room in my head for cross-country and the offside rule. 
Yes, yes, yes, yes, for the moment. But the thing is, you see, the chronodyne generators have to be precisely aligned to generate the vortex. But the sergeant here, he went and moved one. 
But not far enough. The vortex will open here again, but not in a billion years. 
Er, seventy four hours. Three days? Three days to think of something new because now it knows what to expect. Now it has scanned me and it will kill me on sight, thanks to PE here. 
It's a what? 
I'm willing to put a number on it. 
Oh, genius. That is, that is really, really brilliant reasoning. How can you think that I'm her dad when we both look exactly the same age? 
I was being kind. Right, I'm going to hypnotise him. I'm going to erase his memory.  
Tiny little brain, only take a moment. 
Well, I'll try not to erase the whole thing. I'll leave the bits that.
Him? 
No, he's not. 
But he's a PE teacher. You wouldn't go out with a PE teacher. It's a mistake. You've made a boyfriend error. 
You're a soldier. Why would you go out with a soldier? Why not get a dog or a big plant? 
Why would you say that? Is this part of the surprise play? 
Oh, it's a roller coaster with you tonight, isn't it? What about the handsome one, the one with the bow tie? 
Go on. 
Exhibit A. 
(sotto) It's bigger on the inside.
Voila. 
No. I'm going to protect you from that thing. 
Yes, it is coming back, thanks to you. 
And that is the most dangerous thing right there. 
Are you sure hypnotising's not on the menu? 
Look, take him away. Shut him up, shut him down. Up or down, it doesn't matter to me. I've got a lot of work to do. Again. 
Why wouldn't I be okay? I was fine till you two blundered in. 
And when this is all over, you can finish the job. 
Well, you've explained me to him. You haven't explained him to me. 
Afternoon. Thanks for keeping out of my way. You haven't brought Dave with you, I hope. 
Pass me that synestic. 
It'll be a long, fiddly job. It's going to take me at least twenty four hours. Even longer if people keep talking to me, so do keep going. 
If you want bother someone, go and bother PE. 
That's a shame, I like maths. 
Interesting. 
I'm bored. Let's go somewhere fun. What do you say? Do you want to see the Thames frozen over? Oh, those frost fairs. 
It's a time machine. We can get back straightaway, like we always do on your dates. Just make sure you don't get yourself a tan or anything, or lose a limb. 
You've never said no before. Not even in the middle of dinner. Remember when you had to eat two meals in a row? 
Now you mention it, being a Time Lord, I can feel a light shield aura when it's right next to me. 
Might have known what? 
Definitely not. 
And you do not call me sir. 
And you can get out of my Tardis! 
I am not an officer! 
Out. Now. 
Yes. 
Yes, you are! 
On balance, I think that went quite well. 
Humans. I never learn. 
You want to know what's in that box? I'll tell you what's in that box. It's a time machine. It also travels in space. And it usually contains a man who just wants to get on with his work of preventing the end of the world, but keeps being interrupted by boring little humans. 
I'm serious. I'm trying to save this planet. 
Is your name really Disruptive Influence? 
I'll let you know. I may have a vacancy. But not right now. 
Two days. I can do it. 
No, no, no. No! No, no, no, no, no! 
Clara, the vortex is opening. 
PE, shut up. Clara, it'll scan the area. If it gets to parents' evening, it'll kill them all. 
Shut up! 
It'll be here any second. Get to the hall. 
Give it some squirts of helicon energy, setting number forty one. No more than three seconds each, random pulses. Distract it, then you lead it away from the hall, give me two minutes. 
Just run straight to the Tardis. 
Yes, well, I've revised that down to two minutes. Probably. Clara, go. 
No, not like a decoy. As a decoy. Don't they teach you anything at stupid school? 
Yes. Yes, and this is very, very important. Leave us alone! 
Twenty seconds. 
Am I green? Am I green? 
Stop! Skovox Blitzer! 
Superior Skovox Artificer. Analyse stop analyse stop. 
Listening to its superior. This is a rough copy. It thinks I'm its general. Initiate input. Commence shutdown protocol. No conflict. Conclusion? 
Conclusion.  
The input code. I forgot the final input code. 
I need time. Distract it, Clara! 
Artificer Artificer. Stop. Confirm stop override final input code. 
Okay. 
Yes. 
Yeah, yeah. Good start. 
Ah, it can be a bit overwhelming. But look. The Olveron Cluster. A million stars, a hundred million inhabited planets. 
Ah, yes. There has been a spillage. 
To get into museums? 
I've no idea what you're talking about. What, what is Courtney Woods? 
Doing what? 
Oh, her. Oh, that was ages ago. 
Rubbish. 
Pffff. 
Bah. 
Oi! Give over! 
What? 
Vortex manipulators? 
Good. Because I don't like people being sick in my Tardis. No being sick. And no hanky-panky. 
Sorry, that's the rules. 
Tell her what? 
Have you gone bananas? 
(sotto) Pfft. God. (normal) How'd you like to be the first woman on the moon? Is that special enough for you? 
Okay. Now we can do something interesting. 
On a recycled space shuttle. 2049, judging by that prototype version of the Bennett oscillator. 
Where's the gravity coming from? 
About a hundred nuclear bombs. 
Ah. We're on our way to the moon. Check that. We're about to crash into it! Hold on! Hold on! 
Why have you got all these nuclear bombs? 
Oh? Well, you're just going to have to shoot us, then. Shoot the little girl first. 
Yes. She doesn't want to stand there watching us getting shot, does she? She'll be terrified. Girl first, then her teacher, and then me. You'll have to spend a lot of time shooting me because I will keep on regenerating. 
In fact, I'm not entirely sure that I won't keep on regenerating for ever. 
Gravity test. So, it'll be very time-consuming and messy, and rather wasteful, because I think I might just possibly be able to help you. You see, I am a super-intelligent alien being who flies in time and space. Are you going to shoot me? 
Good. Why have you got all these nuclear bombs? No, no, no. Easier question. What's wrong with my yo-yo? 
Bingo. 
Ah ha. We should be bouncing about this cabin like little fluffy clouds. But we're not. What is the matter with the moon? 
It's put on weight. 
Oh, lots of ways. Gravity bombs, axis alignment systems, planet shellers. 
Must be causing chaos on Earth. The tides will be so high that they will drown whole cities. 
So what are you doing about it? 
This? 
Is that the best you could get? 
How many people here? 
Messages? Mayday? SOS? 
So then you came up here to rescue them with your bombs? 
Nobody came? 
You had one. 
I could, but it wouldn't make it true. 
Maybe something trying to find out how you're put together. Or maybe how you tasted. 
Chicken, apparently. 
Save the air. 
They didn't find anything. 
The Mexicans. They didn't find any minerals on the moon at all. Nada. 
Oh. 
Lines of tectonic stress. 
No, no, no. These are much, much bigger. Sea of Tranquillity. Sea of Nectar. Sea of Ingenuity. Sea of Crises. 
Meaning, Clara, that the moon, this little planetoid that's been tagging along beside you for a hundred million years, which gives you light at night and seas to sail on, is in the process of falling to bits. 
Torch. Give me your torch. Whatever it is, it's in here. 
I think we've found your alien. 
Back, back, back! We need a door. A door, a door! 
Come on, come on! There's no power to work it. Come on! 
Stay still. It's sensing movement. It can't see you. Fast movement. There must be another exit through there. Slowly. Slowly. Head to that exit. Slowly. Slowly. Slowly, slowly. (They inch their way.)
Gently, gently. When I say run, run. 
Well, you say run, then. 
Run! We have power. Run! 
You'll be okay! 
Courtney, look at me. Look at me! Courtney! 
Try and get to the door! Try and get yourself down here. 
Courtney, grab my yo-yo! 
Courtney! 
Good stuff, Courtney. Just don't try that at home, okay? 
Did you say germs? Oh, God, this is incredible. Look at the size of it. It's the size of a badger. 
It's a prokaryotic unicellular life form, with non-chromosomal DNA. Which, as you and me know. Well, not you and me. Well, you, certainly not. You and me, yes, scientists know, this is a germ. You flew because that one point three billion tonnes shifted. It moved. It's an unstable mass. 
Which way to the Mare Fecunditatis? 
It was dangerous before. Everything's dangerous if you want it to be. Eating chips is dangerous. Crossing the road. It's no way to live your life. Tell her. You're supposed to be teaching her. 
Course I know what a duty of care is. What are you suggesting? She's fine. What are you, thirty five? 
Now, don't touch anything. 
Oh, don't be so stupid! 
Get in. 
Eh? 
How do you know? 
Maybe it isn't the moon. Maybe it's a hologram or a big painting, or a special effect. Maybe it's a completely different moon. 
I would? 
Clara, there are some moments in time that I simply can't see. Little eye-blinks. They don't look the same as other things. They're not clear. They're fuzzy, they're grey. Little moments in which big things are decided. And this is one of them. Just now, I can't tell what happens to the moon, because whatever happens to the moon hasn't been decided yet. And it's going to be decided here and now. Which very much sounds as though it's up to us. 
Decision made. 
What is killing the moon? 
Everything does, sooner or later. 
Depends what's killing it. 
Well, I've only seen one of them. It would take an awful lot more to cause the moon to put on one point three billion tonnes. 
Argh!
Well, that makes two. 
Shine your light down there. 
Maybe they've been there all the time. It's warmish. They're multiplying, feeding, evolving. 
I agree. Unless something else is going on. 
It's not water. It's amniotic fluid. The stuff that life comes from. I've got to go down there. 
Back to your shuttle. Get your bombs ready. You, get to the Tardis. Get safe. Get Courtney safe. I will be back. 
Today's the day, humankind. 
She's in the shuttle, isn't she? She'll turn up. 
You two have never gotten on, have you? 
Courtney is safe. Och. Well, do you have her phone number? 
Well, what about the school? Does the secretary have her number? 
Phone. I know what the problem is. Oh, she can't post that. She can't put pictures of me online. 
You can't put pictures of me online. 
Yes, yes. It's a rather big problem. 
Well, I had a little hypothesis. The seismic activity, the surface breaking up, the variable mass, the increase in gravity, the fluid. I scanned what's down there. 
The moon isn't breaking apart. Well, actually, it is breaking apart, and rather quickly. We've got about an hour and a half. But that isn't the problem. It's not infested. 
Bacteria. Tiny, tiny bacteria living on something very, very big. Something that weighs about one point three billion tonnes. Something that's living. Something growing. 
That.
No. 
That doesn't live under the moon. That is the moon. 
The moon isn't breaking apart. The moon is hatching. 
The moon's an egg. 
Yes, for a hundred million years or so. Just, just growing. Just getting ready to be born. 
No, no, no, no. It's never been dead. It's just taking a long time to come alive. 
No! 
Courtney, don't spoil the moment. 
I think that it's unique. I think that's the only one of its kind in the universe. I think that that is utterly beautiful. 
Kill the moon? 
Kill the moon. Well, you have about a hundred of the best man-made nuclear weapons, if they still work. If that's what you want to do. 
A hundred nuclear bombs set off right where we are, right on top of a living, vulnerable creature? It'll never feel the sun on its back. 
Well, there'll be nothing to make it break up. There will be nothing trying to force its way out. The gravity of the little dead baby will pull all the pieces back together again. Of course, it won't be very pretty. You'd have an enormous corpse floating in the sky. You might have some very difficult conversations to have with your kids. 
Just stick one into the Tardis console. That'll bring you to me. 
And make sure you hang on to the console, otherwise the Tardis will leave you behind. 
Nothing. 
We don't do anything. I'm sorry, Clara. I can't help you. 
The Earth isn't my home. The moon's not my moon. Sorry. 
Listen, there are moments in every civilisation's history in which the whole path of that civilisation is decided. The whole future path. Whatever future humanity might have depends upon the choice that is made right here and right now. Now, you've got the tools to kill it. You made them. You brought them up here all on your own, with your own ingenuity. You don't need a Time Lord. Kill it. Or let it live. I can't make this decision for you. 
Well, there's two of you here. 
Who's better qualified? 
Oh, take something off his plate. He makes far too many decisions anyway. 
She. Sorry. She hasn't even been into space. She hasn't been to another planet. How would she even know what to do? 
Listen, we went to dinner in Berlin in 1937, right? We didn't nip out after pudding and kill Hitler. I've never killed Hitler. And you wouldn't expect me to kill Hitler. The future is no more malleable than the past. 
Sorry. Well, actually, no, I'm not sorry. It's time to take the stabilisers off your bike. It's your moon, womankind. It's your choice. 
Absolutely not. 
A teenager, an astronaut and a schoolteacher. 
No. Some decisions are too important not to make on your own. 
One, two, three, into the Tardis. 
Let's go and have a look, shall we? 
Mind your language, please, There are children present. 
Nobody's going to die. 
It's feeling the sun on itself. It's getting warm. The chick flies away and the eggshell disintegrates. Harmless. 
You made your decision. Humanity made its choice. 
Well, there you go. 
In the mid-twenty first century humankind starts creeping off into the stars, spreads its way through the galaxy to the very edges of the universe. And it endures till the end of time. 
And it does all that because one day in the year 2049, when it had stopped thinking about going to the stars, something occurred that make it look up, not down. It looked out there into the blackness and it saw something beautiful, something wonderful, that for once it didn't want to destroy. And in that one moment, the whole course of history was changed. Not bad for a girl from Coal Hill School, and her teacher. 
That's what we call a new moon. 
I think that somebody deserves a thank you. 
Okay, Captain. Well, you've got a whole new space programme to get together. NASA is er, it's that way. About two and a half thousand miles. (to Courtney) You still got your vortex manipulators? I'll give you a run home. 
Not that it's any of my business, but I think you did the right thing. 
Nothing. I told you, I've got grey areas. 
I knew that eggs are not bombs. I know they don't usually destroy their nests. Essentially, what I knew was that you would always make the best choice. I had faith that you would always make the right choice. 
It wasn't my decision to make. I told you. 
Well, she really is something special now, isn't she? First woman on the moon, saved the Earth from itself, and, rather bizarrely, she becomes the President of the United States. She met this bloke called Blinovitch 
Well, I didn't do it for Courtney. I didn't know what was going to happen. Do you think I'm lying? 
No, that was me allowing you to make a choice about your own future. That was me respecting you. 
Right. Okay. Er.
Language. 
I was helping. 
Yes. 
Clara. Clara. 
Your train awaits, my lady. 
The baggage car. But thanks for lying. The real wonderful is through here. 
There were many trains to take the name Orient Express, but only one in space.
Completely faithful recreation of the original Orient Express. Except slightly bigger. And in space. Oh, and the rails are actually hyperspace ribbons. But in every other respect, identical. Painstaking attention to detail. 
Most of the time. 
You're doing it again. 
The smile. 
It's the sad smile. It's a smile but you're sad. It's confusing. It's like two emotions at once. It's like you're malfunctioning. 
I just thought this would be a good one to 
Yeah? 
Shall we? 
Oh, I remember when this was all planets as far as the eye could see. All gone now. Gobbled up by that beast. And there's that smile again. I don't even know how you do that. CLARA: I really thought I hated you, you know? 
Well, thank God you kept that to yourself. There was this planet, Obsidian. The planet of perpetual darkness. 
Good, fine. Well, I'm glad that we cleared that up. There was also a planet that was made completely of shrubs. 
Frankly, that would be an absolutely astonishing guess if I did know. 
Were people really confused? Cos I'm confused. Did everybody leave? 
Can I talk about the planets now? 
Thedion Four. Constant acid rain. Had a lovely picnic there once, wearing a gas mask. 
Now, there's a question that's never asked often enough. Let's say intestinal parasites. 
It might be nothing. Old ladies die all the time. It's practically their job description. 
Well, seen by no one except her, which suggests that it wasn't there. A dying brain, lack of oxygen, hallucinations. Anyway, people do just die sometimes. She was over a hundred years old. 
Clara, you actually sound as if you want this to be a thing. Do you? 
Are you sure? 
To our last hurrah. 
Isn't it? 
I thought that's what you wanted. 
Of course. Why wouldn't I do that? 
Is it boring? 
The last hurrah. 
It's nothing. Nothing. Definitely. Sure. Ninety nine percent sure. Really? Ninety nine percent? That's quite high. Is that the figure you're sticking with? Okay, okay. Seventy five. Well, that's jumped quite a bit. You've just lost twenty four percent.
Because you know what this sounds like, don't you? No, do tell me. A mummy that only the victim can see. I was being rhetorical. I know exactly what this sounds like. 
Yes, well, it didn't do Mrs Pitt much good, did it? 
Oh, I don't think so. The records show that the machine did everything it could to keep her alive. 
What do you know? 
Really? Well, I know that when I find a man loitering near a chair that someone died in, I do just the same. 
The Doctor. Nosey Parker. 
What's the most interesting thing about the Foretold? 
You know. The Foretold. Mythical mummy. Legend has it that if you see it, you're a dead man. 
Emil Moorhouse, professor of alien mythology. I'm the Doctor. Pleased to meet you. So, the most interesting thing about the Foretold. Go. 
No, no, no. Nice try. Very atmospheric. But that's not it. Try again. 
The myth of the Foretold first appeared over five thousand years ago. In some stories, there is a riddle or secret word that is supposed to make it stop. Some characters try to bargain with it, offer riches, confess sins. All to no avail. 
I know a lot. Because, from time to time, it turns out to be true. 
Isn't that everyone's dream? But you still haven't answered my riddle. What's the most interesting thing about the Foretold? 
Nope. Even colder. 
Mrs Pitt, the old woman who died. 
No. That's my answer. 
No. The fact that you were here to witness it. 
Excuse me, Professor. 
I think we need to talk. 
I'm not a passenger. I'm your worst nightmare. 
Really? That's your worst? Okay, I'm a mystery shopper. I could do with an extra pillow and I'm very disappointed with your breakfast bar and all of the dying. 
Come on, Captain. Where would we all be if we all followed our job descriptions, hmm? Good question. Glad you asked. In your case, you'd be doing something instead of climbing inside a bottle. 
Yes, I'm sure you have. And I'm sure you do just enough of your job to avoid complaints. 
Wounded in battle, honourable discharge. And this is just a guess, but I think you've had the fight knocked out of you. You expected this to be a cushy desk job where you could put your head down until retirement. Well, I'm sorry. As of today, that dream is over. 
Yes, let's just sit around and wait for the evidence while the bodies pile up. Or here's a crazy thought. We could do something to stop it. Why am I even talking to you? 
Quick work, Perkins. Maybe too quick. 
Sixty six seconds. It fits the myth. Did you see the lights flicker? 
Sleepy-head. Time for breakfast. Knowing this train, it'll taste 
Bad food on trains is traditional. 
Listen, there's been another mummy murder. So our last hurrah 
What? Where are you? 
Clara! 
Ow! Computer, can you open the door, please? 
Oh. Forget it. 
Oh. Now the stupid sonic
I don't know. Some sort of a 
Suppression field, I would guess. And it has to be a guess because, as I say, the stupid sonic screwdriver's not working. What are you even 
What, was I supposed to waken you up? Drag you out of bed 
Is it in there? 
Clara, it's coming. 
But the lights? 
My friend's inside. 
Clara, I'm going to have to call you back. 
You know, I'm going to have to mark you down for this. 
Oh, come on, Captain. How many people have to die before you stop looking the other way? 
Thank you. 
Ladies and gentlemen, could I have a moment of your time, please? There's a monster on this train that can only be seen by those about to die. If you do see it, you will have exactly sixty six seconds left in which to live. But that isn't even the strangest thing. Do you know what is? You. The passengers. Experts in alien biology, mythology, physics. If I was putting together a team to analyse this thing, I'd pick you. And I think somebody has. Someone of immense power and influence has orchestrated this whole trip. Someone who I have no doubt is listening to us right now. So, are you going to step out from behind the curtain and give us our orders? 
And the facade drops away because what use are a bunch of scientists without a lab? 
No. Hard light holograms. They were never really here. Fake passengers to make up the numbers. 
You said capture, implying that you can't control this thing. And yet somehow you got it on board. How? 
And kills at regular intervals. 
No! No! No! 
But even if they agree to this, how are they supposed to study a creature that they can't even see? We don't even know what the species is. 
Perkins, start the clock. 
Oh, dear. Hard cheese. What can you see? Details. 
What kind of bandages? Old? New? 
Whole? Ragged? 
Listen to me! You can see this thing. We can't. Tell us what you can see. Even the smallest detail might help save the next one. 
Well, that is implied, isn't it? Yes, this is probably the end for you. But make it count. Details, please. 
Keep talking. Don't waste this chance.
W-w-w-what? 
This is not a myth. This is real. Forget your superstitions. Tell us what you can see. 
Of course it is. That's why we're here. To study our own demise. So let's get to work. Come on. Chop, chop. 
Clara Oswald. 
Yes. It's where they want us to put the Foretold if we 
Teeny bit busy round here. What else? 
Clara, I have to go. 
Less valuable passengers? How does it choose? 
No, no, no. Not the computer, the Foretold. How does it choose who to kill? We've assumed it's random. What if it's not? I want full histories on all the victims. Medical, social, personal. 
Don't mention it. 
Health? Are you sure? Mrs Pitt, the first victim. She was over a hundred years old. The frailest passenger on board. 
What? 
Because he worked with food. The next one, the guard? 
It's picking off the weakest first. Sensing the illness somehow. The fake organs, even psychological issues. But this is good news, because it means we can work out who is next. I want the medical records of everybody alive who is still on board. If anyone's had as much as a cold, I want to know about it. 
It seems so. Why? 
Which means that you are probably next. Which is good to know. 
Well, of course not for you, because you're going to die. But I mean for us, from a research point of view. 
Well, there's goes our head start. Perkins, start the clock.
What can you see? 
Oh no, no, no, no. That didn't work before. 
Where is it now? 
Am I close? 
If you move, will it follow? 
Keep looking at it, but back off quick as you like. 
Teleporter. That means tech. Then sixty six seconds to do what? Sixty six seconds. That seems very, very specific. Too specific for organic. So, what, more tech? What? More? A countdown clock? Something charging? 
No. No, no, no. We can't do that. We can't mourn. People with guns to their heads, they cannot mourn. We do not have time to mourn. Everybody, what takes sixty six seconds to charge up or to change state? Anyone? Am I surrounded by idiots? If only I could see this thing.
I'm not joking about it. One minute with me and this thing, it would be over! 
Well, ah, on a good day, I'm both. Ancient tech. This thing has been around for centuries. How? Tech that keeps it alive. Tech that drains energy from the living. Scanner. 
Deep tissue scan. He's been leached of almost all energy on a cellular level. The heart attack is just a, is just a side effect. 
But why take sixty six seconds to drain us? Why not just pounce? 
That's why only the victims can see it. It takes them out of phase so it can drain their energy. You, sir, are a genius! This explains everything! Apart from what it is and how it's doing it. Sorry, I jumped the gun there with the you're a genius, that explains everything remark. 
Ah, of course. That makes perfect sense. 
Her bad day, her bereavement, her little breakdown puts her squarely in its cross hairs. She's next. 
We need her here. Even the computer agrees. 
Of course not. Why would you think that? This is another chance 
If it happens in there, it'll be a waste 
Well, I don't know. Lie to her. Tell her I can save her. Whatever it takes to get her here. 
Good for you. 
It's probably Gus trying to block our escape route. 
Well, he has tried to entice me here before. Free tickets, mysterious summons, he even phoned the Tardis number. Do you know how difficult a number
I didn't know. I certainly hoped. 
Not yet. 
Focus. Focus. Focus! All of that is your grief, your trauma, your resentment. And now 
It's mine. 
No. No, it's not. Not for me. Cos now it thinks I'm you. 
Start the clock. (to the mummy) Hello. 
I'm so pleased to finally see you. I'm the Doctor and I will be your victim this evening. Are you my mummy? But you can't hurt me until my time is up. I think. So are there magic words? Is there a way to stop you in your tracks? Oh, you really didn't like your gran, did you? There's something visible under the bandages. By the way, you weren't being paranoid. She really did poison your pony. 
Markings like the ones the scroll. Oh, and your father. Sorry. 
A tattered piece of cloth attached to a length of wood that you will kill for. 
That doesn't sound like a scroll. That sounds like a flag! And if that sounds like a flag, if this is a flag, that means that you are a soldier, wounded in a forgotten war thousands of years ago. But they've worked on you, haven't they, son? They've filled you full of kit. State of the art phase camouflage, personal teleporter. 
And all that tech inside you, it just won't let you die, will it? It won't let the war end. It just won't let you stop until the war is over. We surrender. 
No. 
The clock has stopped. You're relieved, soldier. 
So was he. 
Save it. We're not out of the woods yet. Well, Gus, I think we solved your little puzzle. Ancient soldier being driven by malfunctioning tech. 
Ah, well, there's a shocker. 
My enemy's enemy is my friend. Especially when he has a built in teleporter. 
A little more work. 
Couple of minutes. Max. I'll give you a shout. 
Oh hello, again. Sleep well? 
Oh, that was ages ago. 
And what? Oh, and we got off the train. Oh, well, the teleporter worked eventually. Beamed everyone into the Tardis. No casualties, just a bevy of sleeping beauties. I tried hacking Gus from the Tardis, find out who set this all up. He really didn't like that. Set off some fail-safe thing. Blew up the train. 
Blew up the train. But we got away. Then I dropped everyone off at the nearest civilised planet, which happened to be here. 
You seemed happy asleep so I just left you. 
No, I just saved you and I let everyone else suffocate. Ha, ha, ha. 
Yeah, this is just my cover story. 
I couldn't risk Gus finding out my plan and stopping me. 
Would you like to think that about me? Would that make it easier? I didn't know if I could save her. I couldn't save Quell, I couldn't save Moorhouse. There was a good chance that she'd die too. At which point, I would have just moved onto the next, and the next, until I beat it. Sometimes the only choices you have are bad ones. But you still have to choose. 
Oh, you did, did you? 
Really? Well, I suppose, whoever I did get in, it might just be easier to have them stay on board for a while. I don't suppose you'd know of anyone? 
Yes, it does. Frequently. 
Well, I won't keep you. Goodbye, Perkins. Good to meet you. 
Love what? 
Why would I? 
It's my life. 
Like what? 
You can't really tell if something's an addiction till you try and give it up. 
Let me know how it goes. 
Was that Danny? What did he want? 
Sorry, I 
That's a big change of heart. 
Seriously? 
Well, I'm glad that you said that, because you know that one that's made entirely of shrubs. Are you sure about this? 
No. 
You could leave all that stuff here, you know. We do have literally acres of room. 
Sorry. Stopped listening a while ago. Okay. Er, same time you left, same place-ish.
These readings are very er, ishy. 
Uh huh? 
Well. Well, I wonder what caused this? I don't think we're bigger, are we? 
And a hundred and twenty miles from where we should be. Impressive. 
No. This is impressive. 
This is annoying. The Tardis never does this. This is huge! Well, not literally huge. Slightly smaller than usual. Which is huge. 
Your house isn't going anywhere. And neither is mine until I get this figured out. Could you not just let me enjoy this moment of not knowing something? I mean, it happens so rarely. Look, I don't think this is dangerous, but I wouldn't like you to get squished accidentally. Anyway, I need you to help me find out what's caused this. 
Now, that wasn't me, was it? 
Oh, that can't be good. 
[OC]: Exactly where I was. 
And, no, it's not adorable. It's very, very serious. 
No. I'm exactly the same size. It's merely the exterior dimensions that have changed. 
Stop laughing. This is serious. 
Well, plainly I can't. Something nearby is leeching all the external dimensions. 
Possibly. Oh, who am I kidding? Probably. Sensors are down and I can't risk taking off with it in this state. Clara, I need you to pick up the Tardis. Carefully. It should be possible. I've adjusted the relative gravity. 
Clara, it's always lighter. If the Tardis were to land with its true weight, it would fracture the surface of the Earth. 
I've managed to get a rough fix on the source of the dimensional leeching. 
It's roughly north west. That way. 
Now, listen! You're going to need these. 
No, it does not, so don't get any ideas. 
And listen, stick this in your ear. Can you hear me? 
Nanotech. I just hacked your optic nerve. 
I see what you see. 
Yes, I'm dizzy. But nothing useful. 
No time to fraternize. Come on, get rid of him. 
Don't you dare. 
Of lies. 
Why, Doctor Oswald, you are hilarious. Could we get back to work, do you think? 
Oh, he's a bright one, hang on to him. 
Hello, barely sentient local. 
How do you sleep at night? 
Missing people, tiny Tardis, what's the link? 
Clara, look, I think that we can manage on our own from now on. 
He's a pudding brain. Worse than that, he's a fluorescent pudding brain. 
Do you know, I think that you were wrong about this lad. I think that he could be very useful. Vital local knowledge. 
Yes. So try not to scare him off. 
Clara, this is the scaring off that we were talking about. 
Clara, local knowledge is leaving. Do something! 
I didn't mean that! 
You really do throw your companions in at the deep end, don't you? 
Yes, it's a lovely thought. Which is why I set the sonic to scan for that as soon as we entered. Pleased to meet you. 
Well, of course he might have been squashed under a policeman's shoe by now. 
Do you know, I don't think that statement's ever been truer. 
Yes. Whatever it was, it just drained a massive amount of energy from inside the Tardis. 
I don't know, but that's the least of my problems. Just get us out of here. 
I mean this is just embarrassing. I'm from the race that built the Tardis. Dimensions are kind of our thing. So why can't I understand this? 
Clara, I think that your shrink ray theory was wrong. 
It just struck me. Locked room mysteries. Classic solution number one, they're still in the room. Classic solution number two, they're in the walls. 
What am I missing? The Tardis should be able to detect anything in the known universe. The known universe. This universe. 
Clara, wait, go back. Back, back, back. That mural. That is a nervous system scaled up and flattened. I think we've found PC Forrest. What's left of her, at least. 
The mural in the flat. That wasn't a desert at all. It's a microscopic blow up of human skin. 
Whatever they are, they are experimenting. They're testing. They are, they are dissecting. Trying to understand us. Trying to understand three dimensions. 
Fascinating. Clara, they're in the walls! Keep away from them. If they touch you, you're finished. 
Clara, the window! 
Nice. Not technically lying. 
This explains everything. They're from a universe with only two dimensions. And, yes, that is a thing. It's long been theorised, of course, but no one could go there and prove its existence without a heck of a diet. 
And what long story are you going to tell Danny, huh? Or haven't you made it up yet? 
Excellent lying, Doctor Oswald. 
I meant to me. You told me that Danny was okay with you being back on board the Tardis. 
Yeah, because he doesn't know anything about it. 
Congratulations. Lying is a vital survival skill. 
And a terrible habit. 
What? Oh, right, blowing out that window's possibly affected the earpiece. Take it out and sonic it. 
Look, Clara. Talk to me, talk to me! 
Clara, the mural. Clara, it's the mural! Over there, look, the mural! We've found the missing people, they're in the walls! 
Act normal, but get everyone out. 
What? It takes quite a lack of imagination to beat psychic paper. 
Clara, stop him. 
They're wearing the dead like camouflage. 
Clara, get them out of there! 
I agree. We'll have to think of a better name for them than that. 
Clara, this is a vital stage. This little group is currently confused and disorientated, but pretty soon a leader is going to emerge. You need to make sure that leader is you.
Well done. 
Ah, welcome to my world. So what's next, Doctor Clara? 
What? 
In a manner of speaking. It's true that people with hope tend to run faster, whereas people who think they're doomed
So that's what I sound like. 
Right, here's something that might help you. Do you remember the graffiti from the estate? Footprints, tyre treads? 
Well, I don't think it was graffiti. I think that that is how those creatures saw us. The impressions we make in two dimensional space. That was them reaching out, attempting to talk. At which point they moved into flattening and dissection. Trying to understand. Trying to emulate. But here's the big question. Do they know they're hurting us? 
That's a very good question. Why don't we ask them? 
We need to find a way to communicate. 
Because their idea of language is just as bizarre as their idea of space. Even the Tardis is confused. 
I know a race 
Made of sentient gas who throw fireballs as a friendly wave. I know another race with sixty four stomachs who talk to each other by disembowelling. 
My point being that in a universe as immense and bizarre as this one, you cannot be too quick to judge. Perhaps these creatures don't even understand that we need three dimensions to live in. 
They may not even know that they're hurting us. 
No. I really hope that. It would make a nice change, wouldn't it? Okay. Let's start with pi. Even in a flat world they would have circles. I don't mean edible pie, I mean circular pi. Which I realise would also mean edible pie but anyway. 
They're responding. The Tardis is translating now. It's a number. Fifty five. 
Tenth Fibonacci number. Atomic number of caesium. 
We don't know that. 
Two two. Twenty two. 
Clara, be careful. 
I know. I did see. 
Give me a minute. I'm working on it. 
You can't apply human logic. You're dealing with creatures from another dimension. 
Clara, I might be able to help with that door. Give me five minutes. 
I think I've figured out a way to restore three dimensions. At least on a small scale, say door handles. 
We're not calling it a de-flattener. 
This should be able to restore dimensions. You see what I've called it? 
No. Twodis. It's called the Twodis. (sigh) Why'd I even bother? Well, give it a go, then. 
Clara, I don't know how, but they're doing it again. They're leeching the Tardis! 
They've changed frequency. This time it's different. 
Of course. The next stage. 3D. 
I've boosted the output. 
Absolutely. 
Clara, stop. Use it again. It can reverse the process. 
They have a new ability. Of course they have. Now they're 3D, they can restore dimensions. 
Clara, do you want the good news or the bad news? 
The good news is I've come up with a theoretical way to send them back to their own dimension. 
And that's the bad news. The Tardis doesn't have enough dimensional energy to pull it off. 
Apparently these things can pump it out as fast as they can steal it. 
I don't know. My shields have gone. Structural integrity is failing. Another blow like that and I've had it. 
Er, I'm on the train lines. And there's a train coming. Of course there is. Short-term re-materialisation? Not enough power. Teleport? Not enough power. Re-route the heart of the Tardis through - not enough power! Not enough power! 
Clara, there is no power. The Tardis couldn't boil an egg at the moment. Listen, do what you can to get those people out of there. You're stronger than you know. 
Ha! Di di di. 
I don't know if you can still hear me out there, but the Tardis is now in siege mode. No way in, no way out. I managed to turn it on just before the train hit. But there's not enough power left now to turn it off. 
No, no, no. What are you doing? 
Life support failing. I don't know if you'll ever hear this, Clara. I don't even know if you're still alive out there. 
But you were good! And you made a mighty fine Doctor. 
I tried to talk. I want you to remember that. I tried to reach out, I tried to understand you, but I think that you understand us perfectly. 
I don't suppose it really matters now. You are monsters. That is the role you seem determined to play. So it seems I must play mine. 
The man that stops the monsters. I'm sending you back to your own dimension. Who knows? Some of you may even survive the trip. And, if you do, remember this. You are not welcome here. This plane is protected. I am the Doctor. 
And I name you The Boneless. 
Apparently. Are you okay? 
And a lot of people died. 
It wasn't a fire, those weren't trees, those were people. 
I bet you wouldn't. 
Yes, a lot of people died and maybe the wrong people survived. 
We did. You did. 
Balance? 
Largely so other people don't have to. 
You heard that, did you? 
Yes. 
Ah! The return of the fluorescent pudding brain. 
I know. Your last painting was so good it saved the world. I can't wait to see what you do next. 
Is that PE? 
Talk to soldier boy. 
You were an exceptional Doctor, Clara. 
Goodness had nothing to do with it. 
It's that way.
Are those trees? 
Yes. Do you have an appointment? You need an appointment to see the Doctor. 
When you drink a glass of Coke, it's only this big, but it's actually got this much sugar in it. It works a bit like that.
The Tardis. It's bigger on the inside than the outside, or did you not notice?
Well, of course it's supposed to be bigger. Most people are confused by that.
Miss Oswald? Dark hair? Highly unpredictable? Surprisingly round face? 
The PE teacher.
Mister Pink was looking after you? Well, that explains why you're lost. 
It doesn't surprise you that I know all about your school? 
That's not quite true. I, for instance, have no idea why,  when the terrestrial navigation
The terrestrial navigation starts up, it closes down all the other systems. 
Hmm. That's another of the drawbacks of being the last of your species. No one to ask when your Tardis won't start. 
No, we haven't. We're supposed to be in the middle of London. 
Oh, stop saying that! 
We are in the middle of a forest.
Do I. Sorry, what?
Yes, well, there are some things I've never seen, but that's usually because I've chosen not to see them. Even my incredibly long life is too short for Les Miserables. 
Young female human. Standard defenceless little girl. Your friend Mister Pink was supposed to be looking after her. 
Good point. You. Have you got a name at all?
Trafalgar 
Brand new forest. 
New Forest, except even newer. 
It is amazing, but I saw it first.
No, I can't 
Bring her over. I'm a Time Lord, not a childminder. 
I've got a global rapid afforestation crisis to deal with. 
Why would there be no reading? Because they are actually made of wood. No circuits. No mechanism. Wood.
This is a sonic screwdriver. It interacts with any form of communication you care to mention. Sadly, trees have no moving parts and don't communicate. 
What?
So, what, do you think that's how spring begins? With a group message on Tree Facebook? Do you think they send texts to each other? 
The rings mark the years of growth. One ring for each year. This grew up overnight. That whole tree is the result of just one night's growth, and they're still growing.
Well, having looked at things, I think, probably, the answer to that is no. 
Oh, yes, I am. Very clever. But what use is clever against trees? They don't listen to reason. You can't plead with them. You can't lie to them. They have no moving parts, no circuits. This is a natural event.
Exactly what they said about the Ice Age. How can whole glaciers just pop up out of nowhere? Well, they just did. That's how this planet grows - a series of catastrophes. Farewell to the Ice Age. Welcome to the Tree Age. Possibly. When the Ice Age was here, you lot managed to cook mammoth. Now there's a forest, you'll just have to eat nuts. 
Time. Interesting.
A tree is a time machine. You plant a little acorn in 1795, and in the year 2016, there's an oak tree, there, in the same spot, with a tiny little bit of 1795 still alive inside of it. You can't create an overnight forest with extra special fertiliser. You have to mess with the fabric of time. And communicate with trees.
By trees?
Ask your teacher. Come on! Down from there!  Hey! Away from the console. Come on. That's an antique. Get away from there! Don't touch that! 
Haven't any of you been struck by the fact that it's, look, it's bigger on the inside? 
These trees all appeared at once. That wasn't a coincidence. There's no such thing as an arboreal coincidence. Something, someone has coordinated this. To coordinate, you need to communicate. Every communication channel on the Tardis is open, and nothing.
Except. Let me see that.
Maebh Arden. Maebh Arden. Which one is Maebh Arden? Which one's Maebh? Maebh? Maebh? Maebh? Maebh? Maebh? Maebh? Maebh? Maebh?
Argh! 
We've got to find her!
What do the voices say? 
You people. You never learn. If a child is speaking, listen to it.
He's right. She was trying to tell me something and I ignored her. Maebh Arden is tuned to a different channel. She can lead us to the source, to the heart of the forest. We have to listen to her. We have to find her. 
Does she have a phone? 
Have you got the number? 
Maebh Arden. Five hundred yards south east of here. I'll go get her. 
Hey! Do not. Touch. Anything. Anything. H-h-okay? 
Gifted and talented? Really?
They're in the Tardis, the safest place on the planet. 
If this is an invasion 
It's over. They're here, they've won. What do they want?
Clara!
Doesn't want to be followed? Lost a hold of it in a struggle? Left it as a clue, so we would know where she was going? Trail of breadcrumbs. Hansel and Gretel. 
You just lost a little girl. 
You're pursuing a little lost girl through a mysterious forest. The path has disappeared. You find yourself with a strangely compelling masculine figure. Maebh!
Exactly. The forest. It's in all the stories that kept you awake at night. The forest is mankind's nightmare.
Clara. Is it hers?
Trees control the oxygen on this planet. They withhold it, they smother the fire. What sort of forest is clever? What sort of forest has its own in-built fire extinguisher? 
Why now? 
The whole natural order is turning against this planet. But why? Why now? 
How did she know this?
This is a massive solar flare headed for Earth, like the one that destroyed the Bank of Karabraxos. I've got an entire Tardis and I didn't notice this. But she knew. How? 
You left your marking in the Tardis.
I've just informed you that a solar flare is going to wipe out your planet. You're worried about a row with your boyfriend. How did she know this? She even put the date on it! 
It's today's date. 
They want something. They're saying something. If there is a way, the way is Maebh Arden. 
She's lost someone. People who've lost someone, they're always listening, always looking, always hoping. So, they notice more. They hear more. 
Would that be the London with the zoo? The zoo with the pack of wolves? The zoo whose barriers and gates have probably been mangled by the trees? No, wolves are not impossible. Stick to the path, Red Riding Hood.
Then we're lunch.
Maebh. You came looking for me. You didn't 
Maebh, Maebh, you didn't just stumble into the Tardis. Tell me what you know. 
This is important. 
These are zoo wolves. They're not even used to hunting. 
All right, okay. We've just got to look as if we're too much bother to eat, right? So, stay still. Stay together. Look big. Look big like a big three-headed, six-legged scary thing! 
Ha ha! Told you they were rubbish. Those wolves are terrified.
There are very good solid scientific reasons for being really quite frightened just now. 
No, no. Not her medication. We don't want to shut her up. We want to know what she knows. Maebh, what's the. Maebh, what is this? What is this? 
This is not a nervous tic. This is react 
Maebh. Maebh, this forest is communicating. With you. Nobody else. No technology can hear what it's saying, but you can. Tell us what it wants. Where it came from. Just tell me who did this. 
No, Maebh. You didn't make a global forest appear overnight. How could you do that?
Everything's subject to gravity. If I can create a little local increase 
Who are they?
Here? That's it?
Why now? Why are you here now?
Who is calling you now?
You sent for me. The girl came looking for me. Why? Why me?
Maebh, you came looking for the Doctor. Think. Who sent you for the Doctor? 
Stars implode. Planets grow cold. Catastrophe is the metabolism of the universe. I can fight monsters. I can't fight physics. 
You've been chopping them down for furniture for centuries. If that's love, no wonder they're calling down fire from the heavens. 
They're about to be erased.
We're all going. We're taking the kids. 
I can save you and Danny.
I can save you.
What, you don't want to live?
What?
Say what?
Then why did you bring us all here?
This is my world, too. I walk your earth, I breathe your air. 
Maebh! I'm sorry that I couldn't help you.
Flame-proof forest. Flame-proof forest. A thousand atom bombs and no one hurt. I am Doctor Idiot!
Clara! Mister Pink! Maebh! All of you! Quick, quick! Come back. Come back. Come on. 
Maebh, quick. Good girl, good girl. Come on.
It's there on the screen, look. Big solar flare headed this way. A thousand kilometres a second. Coronal mass ejection. Geomagnetic storm. It's huge. It's brewing up a solar wind
I assumed your teachers have mentioned this? 
Okay. Okay. Well, this is the bad news. The good news is, it's happened before. And you're still here. The Tunguska Blast, 1908. That should have blown the whole planet off its axis, but it didn't. It knocked a few trees over. Well, a few tens of thousands of trees over. Curuçá in Brazil. Same story. Earth should have been smashed, but it wasn't. What do these things have in common?
Trees. Whenever there's a planet-threatening, extra-terrestrial impact, trees. Massive forest, filling the atmosphere with oxygen. Pumping it up like a massive, highly inflammable airbag, so that when trouble hits 
No. The impact burns off the excess oxygen. You have some fairly hectic weather for a few days and some fairly trippy looking sunsets, but apart from that, you will be all right. I was wrong. The trees are not your enemy. They're your shield. They've been saving you since for ever. Protecting you from everything that space can throw at you. 
Atmospheric dust, captured by the trees. The fingerprint of an asteroid. Happy Red Ring Day.
What is it with you people? You hear voices, you want to shut them up. The trees come to save you, you want to chop them down. 
I did admit that I was wrong. Excellent. Mobile networks are still operative. Right. We are going to call everyone on Earth and tell them to leave the trees alone. 
Okay. Okay. Class project. Save the Earth.
Okay, who would like to witness a once in a billion years solar event at close quarters? 
I hope I'm right. It would be slightly awkward if the world was destroyed at this point. 
There goes the planet-sized airbag. That's the trees, harvesting the solar fire. 
You'll all forget it ever happened.
You forgot the last time. You remembered the fear and you put it into fairy stories. It's a human superpower, forgetting. If you remembered how things felt, you'd have stopped having wars. And stopped having babies.
Sorry, I was busy. What's happening?
Well, you're only human.
Clara?
Where are we going? 
From? 
Well, normally you say work or kids or dishes or dullness. So what's happened?
I'm sorry? 
What's so great about seeing a volcano? It's just a sort of leaky mountain. 
It's rubbish.
You can't have one. 
You still can't have one. 
No, you can't have one.
So, volcano. What's so good about lava?
Clara, what are you doing? Don't. Be very, very careful with that. Those are very, very 
Yes. 
No. Not good, Clara.
Yeah?
And?
And? 
No.
Well, I understand you. Let's not get carried away. 
With precision. With great care. And not today. But you know that of course, otherwise you wouldn't be threatening me. 
If I change the events that brought you here, you will never come here and ask me to change those events. Paradox loop. The timeline disintegrates. Your timeline. And yes! 
Yes. I did just say no. Throw away the key.
I know when I can, I know when I can't. Throw the key. 
I am in control. Throw away the key. Do as you are told. 
Well, either you do as you're told or stop threatening me. There really isn't a third option here. 
No. 
No. 
No! 
Neither am I. 
Clara, my Clara, I don't think you will! 
Look in your hand. 
Clara, look in your hand. 
Clara, look in your hand. 
Yes, yes, yes, there is. Look.
Did you seriously think that that was going to work on me? 
They're not sleep patches. They induce a dream state. 
Makes you very suggestible.
I allowed the whole scenario to play out just as you planned. I was curious about how far you would go. 
Yeah. Now I know.
Yes, you're quite the mess of chemicals, aren't you? 
Go to hell.
Clara? You asked me what we're going to do. I told you. We're going to hell. Or wherever it is people go when they die. If there is anywhere. Wherever it is, we're going to go there and we're going to find Danny. And if it is in any way possible, we're going to bring him home. Almost every culture in the universe has some concept of an afterlife. I always meant to have a look around, see if I could find one. 
Well, why wouldn't I help you? 
You betrayed me. Betrayed my trust, you betrayed our friendship, you betrayed everything that I've ever stood for. You let me down! 
Why? Do you think I care for you so little that betraying me would make a difference? Stop it with the eyes. Don't do that with the eyes. How do you do that anyway? It's like they inflate. Cut out the whining while you're at it. We've got work to do. This is it, Clara, one of those moments. 
The darkest day. The blackest hour. Chin up, shoulders back. Let's see what we're made of, you and I. Switching off the safeguards, turning off the nav-com. Remember, we did this before. We plugged you into the Tardis telepathic interface. 
Because you and he are linked. Strongly linked. Your timestreams are intertwined. So if he's anywhere at all, that link will hold. Give me your hands. 
We're in a hurry. 
Clara, I'm terribly sorry, but I'm exactly what you deserve. 
Think about Danny. Think about the man you lost. Let it hurt. Let it burn. But don't bleat. Don't ask, why him? Why me? Forget all that. Ask one question. Just one. Ask, where is Danny Pink now? Where is he now? 
Well, the Tardis thinks he's somewhere.
Nav-com's offline. We'll have to do this old school. 
Almost certainly not. It's where there's a connection with Danny. According to the Tardis, this is where it's most likely that your timeline will re-intersect with his. And that won't do. 
You won't. Look at you. I need sceptical, clever, critical. I don't need mopey. It put years on your face. And what if people see us together? It looks like you've been melted. 
We're here to get your boyfriend back from the dead, so buck up and give me some attitude. 
In a mausoleum? 
It means those are definitely not fish tanks. 
I don't know. 
No. They were placed, after death. These are tombs. Water tombs, some sort of fluid, anyway. 
With chairs, yes. Extra comfort for the deceased. It pays to die rich. 
Good point. Tombs with windows. Who wants to watch their loved ones rot? Why would anyone go to so much trouble just to keep watch on the dead?
Very. Why have the scrolling and a voice? Is it difficult?
Reading all those words back to front. Come on. We've come a long way.
Well, there is, er, no immediate hurry. We're just, er. We're just
Yeah, yeah, browsing. 
Oh, good. That's good to know, Clara, isn't it? 
Exactly what is 3W? 
Well, you know, it's just an unexpected 
(breathless) Clara, is it over now?
Who are you?
You're very er realistic. 
Shut up. 
Oh, yes, please. Please do that. Do that now right now. 
I need to speak to whoever's in charge here. 
Well, who's in charge of you?
Well, who repairs you? Who, who maintains you? 
Who maintains your heart?
Doctor who?
Hello.
Are you okay? 
Good. There would be something very wrong if you were. 
How does the body keep its integrity? Why isn't it just a bunch of bones floating about? 
Why? 
I am thinking about it. Why?
I thought that you would never ask. Sort out your security protocols, they're a disgrace. 
Oh, I've got a lot of internalised anger. What does 3W stand for?
Never mind what we know and what we don't know, just answer our question.
We're not going to freak out. 
She'll be fine. 
Of course. It's the most fundamental fear in the universe. 
So what? 
Why? Was he an idiot?
So, an idiot then. 
Can you just hurry up, please, or I'll hit you with my shoe. 
Fakery. All of it. It's a con, it's a racket! 
This isn't possible. The dead don't come back. 
If they scanned you telepathically, they could've lifted a voice print. It could still be a fake.
Question him. Ask him questions only he'd know the answer to. Be sure. You, with me. 
I've got to check out those tanks. There's something that I'm missing.
Sceptical and critical, remember? Be strong, even if it breaks your heart. 
Who would harvest dead bodies? I feel like I'm missing something obvious. 
And all your dead people are standing. Don't you think you skipped the headline? 
Doctor Chang, your welcome droid has developed a fault. 
Cybermen!
They're Cybermen, all of them. We've got to stop them getting out. 
That's a matrix data-slice. A Gallifreyan hard drive. Time Lord technology.
How did you get hold of Time Lord technology?  Who are you?
Two hearts. 
You're a Time Lord.
Which Time Lady?
Clara. Clara. Clara. I've got to get Clara! 
I presume you have stairs. 
Get away from here! All of you, run! 
Go! Go! Get away from here! Run away!  Run, run! Get away from here all of you, now! 
Get away, go! 
Who are you?
Who's Missy?
We're here to get your boyfriend back from the dead. Those are tombs. Water tombs. Why would anyone go to so much trouble?
A Gallifreyan hard drive. Time Lord technology.
Who are you?
Cybermen in broad daylight? You think people won't notice? 
Nice bow tie.
Bit of a trim. 
Am I?
How much? 
A sun roof on Saint Paul's? Yes, I'd say that was new. 
Everyone in London just clapped and went whee. Hush, I'm trying to count.
Dimensional engineering. One space folded inside another. Bigger on the inside. Easy if you're a Time Lord.
Yep, but one straight up. 
Of course it isn't. 
That's one Cyberman for every city and major town. It's happening everywhere, all over the world, right now.
If it's not exploding, what's it doing?
What are you doing? Explain. Tell me now. 
No. No, no, no, no, I need to talk to her! I need her awake. 
Argh! No. No, no. Stupid. Stupid! No, no. Argh! 
Kate? What's with the handcuffs?
You don't have a future without me. Do you think your father would've done this?
Long story. Where's Clara?
My friend. She was with me in Saint Paul's.
I want her found and brought here. I need her with me.
You got the Tardis out, though?
Where are we going? Cloudbase?
Ah, I see you're bringing Daddy along, too. That's very sweet. 
Oh, don't do that. You look like you're self-concussing, which would explain all of military history, now I think about it.
Love your outfit, Colonel Ahmed. Are you in the Scouts? Are you a Man Scout? I didn't know they had those.
My confidence is growing every minute. 
Mind you, me and Sylvia Anderson, you've never seen a foxtrot like it. Hang on a second. The President? We don't want Americans bobbing around the place. They'll only start praying.
There isn't one. 
That's your answer for everything, isn't it? Vote for an idiot.
Why are you still alive?
I saved Gallifrey.
Gallifrey's lost in another dimension.
Meaning?
You know where it is?
Remember all those years when all you wanted to do was to rule the world? On my way.
Piece of cake.
You'd never believe me if I told you.
That was fairly quick.
Which is?
All of time and space? 
Just something for your bucket list.
Hatching. 
It wasn't rain, Man Scout. It was pollen. Cyber-pollen. Every tiny particle of a Cyberman contains the plans to make another Cyberman. All it has to do is to make a contact with compatible living organic matter and bang! Full conversion. But if they have learned how to convert the dead. 
That's what she was doing. That's what 3W was for. She creates an all-new paranoia among the super-rich about dying. She exploits the wealth and the mortal remains of selected idiots so she can create a whole new race of Cybermen. Cybermen who can recruit corpses. Throw away your guns, Man Scout, it's all over. How can you win a war against an enemy that can weaponise the dead? 
They're newborns. Give them time. Why were you there this morning? Why were you already attacking?
Can't play to the gallery unless there's a gallery, and here I am. 
Dead bodies don't have minds, of course, but she's been upgrading dying minds to a hard drive for a long time. So she upgrades the hardware, and then she updates the software.
Well, she must have a Tardis somewhere, so as long as she likes. The past, the future  
How long has the human race had a concept of an afterlife? Turns out the afterlife is real, and it's emptying. Every graveyard on planet Earth is about to burst its banks.
I don't like being the president. People keep saluting. I'm never going to salute back. 
He should've asked.
The clouds. Still there. So what else have they got? 
There's a Cyberman out there on the fuselage. But on the plus side, it's not turbulence. 
She's out. Who let her out?
Shut up!
For what?
It was you! 
You put us together.
Why? 
Clara?
Danny's dead, Clara. 
Clara? 
Clara, don't do it. Just don't do it!
I know what it does. If you turn it on 
Not yet, he isn't. 
I'm not going to help you commit suicide.
Clara? Clara, no  
Why did you do that? You didn't have to do that!
Aaah! Aaah! 
Argh! Argh!
Clara, don't! 
If you do what you're trying to do, if you succeed, he will snap you.
Then he will step over your broken body and break another and another and another. He will never stop. 
P E. P E. P E.
I had a friend once. We ran together when I was little. And I thought we were the same. But when we grew up, we weren't. Now, she's trying to tear the world apart, and I can't run fast enough to hold it together. The difference is this. 
Pain is a gift. Without the capacity for pain, we can't feel the hurt we inflict.
Of course I can.
Yes. Oh, yes.
Danny, Danny, I need you to tell me. What are the clouds going to do? What is the plan?
You're part of a hive mind now. Presumably that's how you found Clara. Just look.
Look harder.
(sighs) I need to know. I need to know.
No. 
Yes.
Clara, no! Step away! He's activating! Clara, step away now! Don't. Danny. Danny, if you can hear me, if you're still there, what are the clouds going to do?
And rise again as Cybermen.
How do we stop it? 
Don't you dare! Don't you think about it!
What gift? 
All of this. All of it, just to give me an army?
I don't want an army! 
Nobody can have that power. 
Why are you doing this?
Thank you. Thank you so much. 
I really didn't know. I wasn't sure. You lose sight sometimes. Thank you! I am not a good man! I am not a bad man. I am not a hero. And I'm definitely not a president. And no, I'm not an officer. Do you know what I am? I am an idiot, with a box and a screwdriver. Just passing through, helping out, learning. I don't need an army. I never have, because I've got them. Always them. Because love, it's not an emotion. Love is a promise. 
And he will never hurt her. P E, catch!  
You didn't notice, did you? While you were doing all your silly orders, while you where showing off, the one soldier not obeying. 
Yes, burned up. Totally burnt. Burnt to nothing. Sorry.
What did you say??
You are lying!
You'd be clapped in irons.
No. No, don't you dare. I won't let you.
Clara, all I'm doing is not letting you kill her. I never said I was letting her live.
If that's the only thing that will stop you, yes. 
You win.
Kate. She's breathing! She's alive! She can't be here.
She fell out of a plane. The Cyberman must have caught her.
Of course. The Earth's darkest hour and mine. Where else would you be? 
(sotto) Thank you.
Hey. 
I got your message.
Not bad. 
I see you've got news for me. 
He figured it out then? P E figured out there was a way home.
Oh, good old P E. He'll make a maths teacher yet.
I know.
I know exactly what you've got to tell me.
You and Danny are together now. That's great. That's how it should be. But the old man and the blue box, that's never going to fit in. So no more flying around. No more lying. 
It's fine.
I've found Gallifrey.
I entered the coordinates, just like she said. And I found Gallifrey. For once, she wasn't lying. 
Go home.
Gallifrey can be a good place. I can help make it that.
Shut up!
No, not this time. Never again. 
It's a long commute, so, you know, I thought, with you and Danny 
Yeah, I might do that.
Yeah, queen, that would be good too.
What? What habit?
Why not. Within reason. 
Come on, you're on the clock.
Never trust a hug. It's just a way to hide your face.
Thank you for exactly the same.
Clara, I want you to step inside the Tardis. I don't want you to talk, I want you to do as I ask. Please. 
Yes, I'm really here. I'm back. Now get inside the Tardis. 
I know what this is. I know what's happening, and I know what's at stake. 
Happy Easter. 
Nobody likes the tangerines.
There's something you have to ask yourself, and it's important. Your life may depend on it. Everybody's life. Do you really believe in Santa Claus? 
Deaf. Blind. How can they see us? How do they even know that we're here? 
Oh, telepathic. They can home in on their own image in someone else's brain. Third-party perception. Mind piracy. We're being hacked. 
The visual input from your optic nerve is being streamed to their brains. Stop broadcasting. Close your eyes. 
It's because you're still thinking about them. So long as you retain them as an active memory, they can still home in. Think about something else. 
(sotto) She's running interference. She's trying to distract herself. Three hundred and four minus seventeen. 
Plus twenty. Just do it! 
Minus fourteen, times four. 
Stop being so good at arithmetic. 
Danny Pink! What is Danny Pink up to right now? He's probably flirting with your neighbour or texting women of low moral character. 
I was only 
No, he's not. 
Come on, quick, quick, quick, come on! 
No! 
Oh, take a guess. Go on, push the boat out. Tooth Fairy, maybe? Easter Bunny? 
Oh, very good. 
I've heard of them. 
Colloquially known as the Dream Crabs. 
I don't know. Possibly. 
Oh, definitely. 
Guess. 
Do you believe that?
Theorise. 
And? 
Meaning? 
Go to the window. 
Because it gets worse. 
That's how Clara and I got here. 
Technically, in a telephone kiosk. 
Because it's a spaceship in disguise. You know what the big problem is in telling fantasy and reality apart? 
They're both ridiculous. 
Exactly. 
Oh, we are well way past danger, Clara. If I'm right, and I usually am, we're dying. 
I like you. Straight to the point. I want you to show me how you first encountered those creatures, and what happened to those people in the infirmary. I notice you all wear mini-cams, so I assume that there is footage. 
If it helps, so am I. 
Ashley, what's this polar base for? Why are you all here? 
I know. I had to flood your mind with random emotion. 
You never told me he was dead. You said he made it back. 
I never found Gallifrey. I lied, so you'd stay with Danny. 
Yes. 
Oh, complicated. 
No idea. 
Trust nothing. Accept nothing you see. Whatever happens, interrogate everything. 
In case it's a lie.
You all right? 
You don't seem much like a scientist. 
Why are you out here? What brought you to the North Pole? 
You missed the killer question. 
Beardy-Weirdy. 
How do you get all the presents in the sleigh? 
What am I looking at? 
What is your main mission? 
Until you looked at them too long. Till you thought about them. 
Sleeping. Probably been down there for centuries. 
They can detect their own mental picture in any nearby mind. 
Oh. That was always the legend. You think about a Dream Crab, a Dream Crab is coming for you. 
Okay, then what? 
Face huggers? 
There's a horror movie called Alien? That's really offensive. No wonder everyone keeps invading you. 
And then they became aggressive. 
It would take the Dream Crab a little while to take control. Depends how much of the host brain was 
Digested. 
Depends what you call alive. 
No. No, no. no, no, no. The Dream Crab induces a dream state. Keeps you happy and relaxed, in a perfectly realised dream world, as you dissolve. Merciful, I suppose. 
Compared to that turkey leg you keep eating. Could you rewind for me? I'd like to see them dormant again. Clara, could you fetch me the dead one? 
Ooh. Yes, and a punch in the face, too. 
Fair enough.
We're thinking about it. Clara!
Clara, you're dreaming. You're dying. Can you hear me? Clara? 
Okay, we kill it. We find a way to kill it and we get it off of her. How do we kill it? 
Santa. In the infirmary, you told the Sleepers to go to bed, and they obeyed you. 
No, but you can get back in there unharmed. 
And how would you know that? How did you become an expert on what does and doesn't exist? 
Good. Because there is only one way that I can communicate with Clara.
Hi. 
It's not real, Clara. You know it's not real. It's a dream, and it's killing you. 
Not as well as you, clearly. You've made him a fraction taller. Merry Christmas, PE. 
Dialogue's pretty good, too. Nice work. It's all in the detail. 
He's not real, Clara. None of this is real. What's real is there is an alien organism wrapped around your face, keeping you warm and happy while it eats you. 
You're dying. 
There was only one way to get to you. 
I'm dying, too.
You have a pain right here. It's like an ice cream pain, but gentle. Do you know what that is? The skin and bone have been parted, probably half an inch, and something has pushed right into the soft tissue of your brain and is very slowly dissolving it. I want you to picture it this way. Somebody has put a straw right through your skull and is drinking you. You should be screaming with agony, but there's anaesthetic. Everything around you right now, even Danny, especially Danny, that's the anaesthetic. 
Because it's true. How long do you think you've been here? 
No. No, no, no. Barely five minutes. Because dream time goes faster. Because this isn't real. Danny isn't real. Danny Pink died saving the world. 
I'm sorry. I thought there was a way back for him, but I was wrong. I can't change that. He's dead. 
Minutes, till it's irreversible. 
Brave. 
I don't know. Just try. Accept this isn't real, and try. 
Clara? Clara, look at me, Clara! Clara! Breathe, breathe. Breathe. Breathe. 
The carnivore's hazard. Food has teeth too. You okay? 
Good. There are some things we should never be okay about. 
No. And the pain's still there, isn't it? 
But only on one side, just that spot there. Doesn't that strike you as odd? 
Theorise. 
Do you? And have you ever woken up from a dream and discovered that you're still dreaming? Dreams within dreams. Dream states nested inside each other. All perfectly possible, especially when we are dealing with creatures who have weaponised our dreams against us. 
Which is odd, when you think about it. 
Impossible, in fact. How can any of us be awake? 
Remember how we all first met, in the infirmary? 
All those creatures coming down from the ceiling, attacking us. 
We never stood a chance. How did we survive that? 
Yeah, we were rescued. And who was it that rescued us?
The Helman-Ziegler test. The only reliable dream test that I know. Ah. Your base manual. I take it none of you have memorised this. 
These books should be identical in the real world. But as they don't exist in your memory, in a dream, they can't be. Agreed? Clara. Give me any two digit number. 
All right, all of you, turn to page fifty seven and look at the very first word. Right, when I point at you. 
Well? 
Well, we'll do it again. Clara? 
Twenty four. 
Shona? 
The attack is still going on. This is it! 
Seriously? You're trying to help? 
This makes perfect sense. The Dream Crab tries to make the dream as real as possible to trap you inside it. It creates dreams within dreams so you can never be sure if you are really awake. But your brain knows something is wrong. Your subconscious fights back. This is your mind trying to tell you this isn't real. 
Exactly. 
No. No, no. Hang on. No, no, no, no. 
It's a spaceship in disguise. 
Shut up, Santa. 
Look. No. Look, we don't need all this touchy-feely stuff. 
No. No, No, no, no. Line in the sand. Santa Claus does not do the scientific explanation. 
Why don't you just go and, and make a naughty list? 
Don't give me that. Look, you're supposed to be warm and friendly and cheerful. 
Don't be so hostile, 
I'm not very good with this holdy-hand thing. 
I will hold Clara's hand, but that's it. 
Oh no, I'm fine, I'm fine. This is very Christmassy, isn't it? 
We're waking up. That part of the dream is over. We're on our own now. 
That pain in your head. Make it worse. Head towards it. 
Only a few moments will have passed at the most. The attack is still in progress. 
Congratulations. That means you're not an idiot. 
Last time wasn't real. 
Run! 
Clara! 
Clara? Come on! 
Everyone all right? Good. Bye. 
No need for chatting, you'll only get attached. This isn't Facebook.
Oh, they're fine. 
Beyond help. 
Only if they're stupid. There are polar bears on this ice cap. Am I supposed to do something about that, too? 
There are lots of dangerous things on this funny little planet of yours, Clara, most of which you eat. I'm the Doctor, not your mam. 
Four. Four patients. Four manuals. Hurry! Do you know what I hate about the obvious? 
Missing it. 
As you were. No saluting. Are you the same people as before? 
Oh, sorry, I deleted you. 
Four manuals, yes? 
One each. 
Well, the problem is, you can't see the problem. For instance, you, gobby one. 
Doesn't matter. I don't need it. When we first met you in the infirmary, what were you doing? 
Uptight boss one. (another manual) What is the primary mission of this polar base? 
Sexy one. What brings you to the North Pole at your age? 
If you think that's freaky, try this. We were in the Tardis. Why did we come here? 
Dreams. They're funny. Ha, ha, ha. They're disjointed. They're, they're silly. They're full of gaps. But you don't notice, because the dream protects itself. Stops you asking the right questions. For example, why do you have four manuals, one each, when you have a crew of eight? Or did you forget about your friends in the infirmary here? 
Dreams within dreams, I warned you. 
No one knows they're not dreaming. Not one of us. Not ever. Not for one single moment of our lives. Clara? Page number. Make it a good one. 
And who's going to be the first to admit it? 
That the pain is still there. 
Yes, there is an alien organism in your brain, eating it. Of course it's getting worse. 
Factually, getting up. Significantly, sensing the endgame. 
Well, look at them. Go on. Look at them. Look at them properly. Look who they are. They're you. The Sleepers are you. 
Because we're dreaming, all of us. This base isn't real. None of us are actually standing in the room. I'm probably asleep in my Tardis. Clara, you must be in bed. God knows where the rest of you are, probably scattered all over the world. But wherever you are, the Dream Crabs have got us, and we're all being networked into the same nightmare. 
It's your subconscious again. The Sleepers represent the part of your mind that's already surrendered to the attack. These are dream images of what's coming to kill you. 
No, it's a metaphorical construct representing a psychic attack within a shared dreamscape. Do please keep up. 
Don't get too close. 
Because this is a nightmare. 
No! Clara! 
Look out, they're coming through. Out! Outside, now! Run, run, run, run! Run! Clara, run. Run, all of you, run. Run! 
This dream just killed your friend. Start taking it seriously. 
He probably just woke up somewhere in the real world, dead. If we don't wake up now, we'll do the same. 
I don't know. 
The Tardis! Come on! Come on! 
Well, let's hope that I dreamed it really well, then. 
Of course it's us. We're dreaming too. 
The logic of a nightmare. 
We have to leave this place. 
Use your imagination. 
Dream yourselves home. 
Come on, it's Christmas, the North Pole. Who you gonna call? 
Could be. Well, I hope so. Waking up or 
Just focus on this. Do you believe in Santa Claus? 
You're a dream construct, currently representing either my recovering or expiring mind. 
Yeah. All right. 
Sorry, sorry, sorry. 
No, no, no! Oh, ho ho! Ah! 
Look at me. Look. Look at me! 
Look at me! I'm riding a sleigh. I'm riding a sleigh. Yippee ai-yay! 
Oh. Maybe you could 
Possibly. With any luck, we'll all wake up in our proper times and places. 
Well, we could all be from different time zones. Time travel is always possible, in dreams. 
The chances of you remembering any of this are very slim. 
We stay, we die, Clara. 
Clara!
Oh, Clara. I might have known that you would be the one to sleep in. Okay, I tracked the psychic signal here. I'm pretty sure that I know how to do this now. One of the advantages of actually being awake. So, you just hold still. I've just got to zap the neural centres. 
Okay, there you go. 
The Dream Crabs must have got to me first then found you in my memory. The others were collateral damage. Well, good to see you properly at last. How long has it been? Clara. 
I've missed you, too.
These are Christmas hats, I've seen people use them. You put them on and absolutely anything seems funny. 
Probably not. You want to try? 
Clara Oswald, you will never look any different to me. So, how was it then? 
The sixty two years that I missed. 
Is there a Mister Clara? 
They all turned you down though? 
Regrets? 
Yeah, they're always the best part. Christmas cracker. We should do one. No one ever matched up to Danny, eh? 
Why not? 
We should do this every Christmas. 
I'm sorry. I was stupid. I should have come back earlier. I wish that I had. 
No. I'm not still 
Clara!
No idea. 
Is that any good? 
The Tardis is outside. 
So, all of time and all of space is sitting out there. A big blue box. Please, don't even argue. 
Merry Christmas, Clara Oswald.
Do you know what's rarer? Second chances. I never get a second chance, so what happened this time? Don't even know who to thank. 
No. 
Why do you always assume I'm lying? 
No. 
Soon. 
No. 
Yes. 
He and I've known each other a long time. 
An enemy's just a friend you don't really know yet. Sorry. What, was that me being cynical again? 
That's different. I don't like you! 
You know who to give that to? 
I won't go straight away. I'll hang out for a bit. Probably meditate on a rock somewhere. Get myself ready. 
You could say that about being born. 
Look after the universe for me. I've put a lot of work into it. 
How many days have I been here?
Three hours? 
Maybe Clara's right. She keeps telling me I've got Attention Deficit er something or other.
You can't come with me, Bors. 
I didn't save your life. You had a splinter.
Someone I know is very sick. He'll want to see me before (pause) while there's still time.
Someone I've known a very long time.
You can't help me, not where I'm going. I have to get myself ready. I have to be alone. I have to think. No more distractions.
Urgh. Hang on a minute. (stands up) The water. 
I don't like it. I can't meditate properly without decent water. 
We're going to dig a well! Right on, er, this spot. There will be excellent water here.
Oh, I'm very good at water.
This is definitely a good spot for water.
Well, twelve is my lucky number. 
Here. No, here. Look at this grass. This is watery grass. Follow the squelchy.
Yes, I suppose it can. Except. 
Do you know what this well really needs?
A visitor's centre.
Look at this coin. You see it?
Where is it now?
No, it isn't.
Are you sure? I'm really a very good magician.
Why would I dread anything?
I thought you were an idiot.
Good. I was worried I would have to break it to you
I've been avoiding it. One last night, then I have to go.
I have to prepare myself.
I did something wrong. I let somebody down when I should have been brave enough and strong enough to do better. Tomorrow I pay the price. Tonight, I make myself ready.
You do realise you're still an idiot.
Good. I have to be quiet now. Quiet as the grave.
Oh? Oh, well, we'll see about that, shall we?
No more distractions. Got to focus. No more distractions. Bors! 
Are you any good with a broadsword?
Fancy a friendly?
(standing) I suppose I do owe you.
Yes. Yes, you have.
Well, a little while ago, a very long way from here, I was looking for a bookshop. Instead, I found a battlefield. Story of my life. I've seen many battlefields. But this one will be different. This one will be my last.
The device in your hand is creating an acoustic corridor, so that we can talk. Do you understand?
Oh, I'm just a passer-by. I was looking for a bookshop. How do you think I'm doing?
No, this is a war. A very old one, going by the mix of technology. Which war is this? I get them all muddled up.
Where am I? What planet is this?
Well, neither do I. I try never to understand. It's called an open mind. Now, you have got to make a choice.
Yes, you have got to decide that you're going to live. Survival is just a choice. Choose it now.
I told you, you have one chance in a thousand. But one is all you ever need. What's your name? Come on, faith in the future. Introduce yourself! Tell me the name of the boy who isn't going to die today.
You said you wanted an axe fight.
Oh, come on. In a few hundred years, that'll be really funny. It's a slow burner.
Yes, and a daffodil is not a broadsword, but I still won the last round!
What do you think of my tank? Don't worry, it isn't loaded.
No, neither do I. I bought it for my fish.
I may have ordered online!
Oh, come on. Fish? Tank? Honestly, this stuff will be hilarious in a very few hundred years. Do please stick around.
Now, you lot. I have been here all day, and it's been a great day!
Three weeks? It must be nearly bedtime. Well, we've partied.
Yes! I helped you dig a well, with a first-class, child-friendly visitor's centre! I've given you some top-notch maths tuition in a fun but relevant way. And I have also introduced the word "dude" several centuries early. Let me hear you!
Are you a Renaissance?
Are you a Medieval?
I am a dragon-slaying?
We are all the young?
I like it. But I've got some sad news for you, dudes. Tonight, I'm going to have to leave you.
But before I do, I'd like you to meet a couple of friends of mine.
When do I not see you?
There was a crowd, too?
Well, you know what they say. Hugging is a great way to hide your face.
I spent all day yesterday in a bow tie, the day before in a long scarf. It's my party, and all of me is invited.
It's the wicked stepmother! Everyone hiss!
Well, I've got some good news about that.
It's still today!
Bors. Is it a marble again? Did you swallow one of the marbles I gave you? Don't swallow marbles!
Says you and whose army?
Nobody dies here. Not one person, not one of my friends, do you understand?
So I hear.
Then you will harm nobody in this place. Not one person. Are we very, very clear?
You want to know how dangerous I am? Davros sent you. You know how stupid you are? Huh! You came!
Is that supposed to frighten me? Snake nest in a dress? Now, explain, politely. Davros is my arch-enemy. Why would I want to talk to him?
Hush!
Er, it was.
I don't have a screwdriver any more.
Is your ship in orbit?
I am prepared.
Yes. Goodbye. (sotto) Goodbye, Clara.
No! No, no, no. Under no circumstances! What are you doing now?
No, no, no! I forbid it, no! No! No! No! No!
Davros is the child of war, a war that wouldn't end. A thousand years of fighting, till nobody could remember why. So Davros, he created a new kind of warrior, one that wouldn't bother with that question. A mutant in a tank that would never, ever stop. And they never did.
How scared must you be to seal every one of your own kind inside a tank? (a pause) Davros made the Daleks, but who made Davros?
So that's where he ended up.
I don't know. A hospital?
Who knows? It's always the way with hospitals. 
Well, we've known each other a long time. She's one of my own people.
I'm sorry.
(sotto) Gravity.
Davros.
Clearly.
I still do.
Yes, yes, yes, okay, you've made your point.
I get the point.
You flatter me.
You were very wrong.
It ended in the Time War.
No!
Skaro! You've brought me to Skaro.
(sotto) Clara!
What are they going to do? Tell me, what?
(sotto) Don't. Just don't.
(sotto) No. Missy, no!
Please! Please, I'm begging you. Please, please. Please, save Clara.
(sotto) Oh, Clara. Oh, my Clara.
Why have I ever let you live?
From the future.
I'm going to save my friend the only way I can.
Exterminate!
Genius.
Get out.
Get out!
Admit it. You've all had this exact nightmare.
So,anyone for dodgems?
Of course, the real question is, where did I get the cup of tea? Answer? I'm the Doctor. Just accept it.
Proposition. Davros is an insane, paranoid genius who has survived among several billion trigger-happy mini-tanks for centuries. Conclusion? I'm definitely having his chair.
I'm guessing his personal forcefield only works in one direction.
Doesn't he? Ah, listen to your little hearts beat!
Ask me what I want.
I've been at the heart of your empire for forty two minutes, and I own it, and I haven't even got out of my chair. Ask me what I want.
Clara Oswald. 
I want Clara Oswald, safe, alive, and returned to me immediately. You bring her back. You do that. You do that now. Unharmed. Unhurt. Alive.
I saw what happened. I was there. And I'm hoping, for all of our sakes, that it was a trick.
Because if Clara Oswald is really dead, then you'd better be very, very careful how you tell me.
Who's going to go first?
Everything he had, I have.
Davros. You're up. Sorry, this seat's taken.
You neither.
I gave it up. Bad memories.
You keep saying that, you keep not dying. Can you give it some welly? Come on.
We have no business.
They don't have much respect for you, do they? Your kids. Have you seen the state of this place? I mean, this is exactly where you dump a smelly old uncle slash family pet slash genius scientist who couldn't even invent legs. Seriously, how do your boys take it when everybody else has got two eyes? 
Oh, yes. It's a hyperspace relay, with some kind of a genetic component.
Ooo. Nice. Vampiring off your own creations, just to eke out your days. I'm surprised the Daleks allow it.
What defect?
Er, why would you be telling me this?
There's no such thing as the Doctor. I'm just a bloke in a box, telling stories. And I didn't come here because I'm ashamed. A bit of shame never hurt anyone. I came because you're sick and you asked. And because sometimes, on a good day, if I try very hard, I'm not some old Time Lord who ran away. I'm the Doctor.
Always.
I hope so.
I wouldn't die of anything else.
Yeah, well, if you're going to put your hand on my knee, it isn't going to go well.
Well, because I did.
It's a boring place, Gallifrey. I was going out of my mind.
Ah, well, I'm inconsistent.
What lie?
I do. 
Don't you dare!
Some things matter to me, Davros. Not many, but a few. And you don't put your fingers anywhere near them.
And they'd better not be scratched. These are my best ones.
Well, by now that should make you nervous.
How long has it been, you and I?
And now you ask me a personal question?
My people are alive. They didn't die. I brought them back. I found a way.
Gallifrey is back in the sky. I don't know where, I may never know. But Gallifrey is back and it is safe from both of us.
I'm sorry?
Why are you saying that?
I don't, I don't understand this. Why are you 
You've seen it often enough.
You really are dying, aren't you?
Yes.
What?
How did you get it back?
No, like you. Everything you are, they are.
I'm trying to pep this up, but you've been going a long time. Every Dalek on Skaro isn't enough any more.
I'm not helping you. I'm helping a little boy I abandoned on a battlefield. I think I owe him a sunrise.
Come on, chin up.
Any minute now 
Here it comes.
Look, the sun's coming up. We're on the same side now.
Okay, don't ever tell anyone that I did this.
A little bit of regeneration energy. Probably cost me an arm or a leg somewhere down the line. Or I'll just be really little.
Should be enough, just to 
What are you doing?
No! No! No, please! No!
Please you must, you must stop this. You must stop this!
Stop!
Where's Clara?
You're alive, so she is too. Where is she?
Three.
Two.
One.
I knew exactly what you were doing, and I let you do it. You transmitted regeneration energy into every Dalek on this planet. Every single one.
One word. Er, no, two words, actually. First word, moron.
Second word, sewers.
Generations of Daleks just woke up very cross, and they are coming up the pipes. Or to put it another way, bye! 
This city is about to be sucked into the ground. Your own sewer is about to consume you. There's no way you can win, there is nothing you can do, so just tell me, where is Clara Oswald?
Yes, you're a Dalek. Where is Clara?
Yes, I know that you're a Dalek. Where is Clara Oswald? 
Is Clara dead?
You shouldn't be able to say that.
That word shouldn't exist in your vocabulary. How did Davros teach you to say that?
Why aren't you trying to kill me?
I'm putting the gun down. Open your casing.
Just think the word "open". It'll work. 
Missy, run.
I'm sorry, Clara. I'm so sorry!
I said, run.
Where was the Tardis? It was over there somewhere, wasn't it? 
Dalek Supreme, your sewers are revolting.
Oh, well, go on, then. Exterminate away. 
Oops, sorry. Tardis force field is still here. We get in, you don't.
Ah, don't be silly, of course it hasn't. It just redistributed itself for a moment. Hostile Action Dispersal System. I'll give it a quick blast from my sonic, and the real time envelope will reassemble right here.
Oh, yeah, I'm over screwdrivers. They spoil the line of your jacket. These days, I'm all about wearable technology. 
Oh, same old, same old. Just the Doctor and Clara Oswald in the Tardis.
It doesn't make sense. 
When you were in the Dalek, you made it say mercy.. It shouldn't have understood the concept, it shouldn't have been able to say it. How did a tiny piece of mercy get into the DNA of the Daleks?
From the future.
I'm going to save my friend the only way I can. Exterminate! 
Come on, I'll take you home.
I'm not sure that any of that matters, friends, enemies. So long as there's mercy. Always mercy.  
What's wrong? You're not happy. Why aren't you happy? Tell me. 
Why have you brought us here? 
Underwater. Some sort of a base. The technology's twenty second century. Maybe military, maybe scientific. 
Must be, somewhere, if there's oxygen. 
I think there was more to it than that. Whatever it was, it happened pretty recently. 
Seven or eight hours ago. No bodies, though. 
Look. Told you. Crew. 
Hello, sailors! 
Right, I did not expect that. Hands up who expected that. 
Wait, wait. I don't think they're going to hurt us. I think that they're just curious. 
Well, I mean, define sure. Look at you lovely chaps. What's happened to you, then? 
Come on. 
I haven't a clue. Isn't that exciting? 
No, it's alien. 
That's weird. The Tardis hasn't translated it. 
Hello! Did you want to show us this? It's very nice. 
Yes, I spotted that, too. 
Was it something she said? She does that. She once had an argument with Gandhi! 
What are you? 
This is Clara, and I'm the Doctor. 
Well, if that's what it says. 
Tell me, what about those things out there? What are they? Why are they trying to kill us? 
They're not ghosts. 
Thank you, but I actually don't need your help. I can speak sign. (signs) Go ahead. 
No, no, actually, I can't. It's been deleted for semaphore. Someone get me a selection of flags. 
He's from the planet Tivoli. 
Weird thing is, they're not violent. They're too cowardly. They wouldn't say boo to a goose. They're more likely to give the goose their car keys and bank details. When did they first appear? 
It's a Faraday cage. Completely impenetrable to radio waves, and apparently, whatever those things are out there. So, who's in charge now? I need to know who to ignore. 
The oil? Where are we? 
I'd like to have a further look at that spaceship, but what about those things that aren't ghosts? 
If whatever they are  
They're not ghosts. Have been trying to kill you, why haven't you abandoned the base? 
It's okay. I understand. You're an idiot. Come to mention it, why is there a Faraday cage on the base? 
So, we are fighting an unknown homicidal force that has taken the form of your commanding officer and a cowardly alien, underwater, in a nuclear reactor. Anything else I should know? Someone got a peanut allergy, or something? 
It all started with this ship. This is where the answer will be. 
What's happened to the stuff you've removed? This is for long-haul flights. There should be a suspended-animation chamber for the pilot right here. Plus, one of the power cells is missing. 
Yeah. You can see the casing is empty. 
What? 
Well, they can zap a vessel from one side of the galaxy to the other, so, you know, take a wild stab in the dark. 
Yes, well, otherwise. Sorry, why is this man still talking to me? 
So what have we got? Moran dies, and then those things appear. They can walk through walls. They only come out at night and they're sort of see-through. 
They're ghosts! Yeah, ghosts  
Yes, well, well, there was no such thing as, as socks or smartphones and badgers until there suddenly were. Besides, what else could they be? They're not holograms, they're not Flesh Avatars, they're not Autons, they're not digital copies bouncing around the Nethersphere. No, these people are literally, actually, dead. Wow. This is, it's amazing! I've never actually met a proper ghost. 
Oh! Oh, right you are. 
Ahem. I'm very sorry for your loss. I'll do all I can to solve the death of your friend slash family member slash pet. 
But don't you see what this means? Death! It was the one thing that unified every single living creature in the universe, and now it's gone. How can you just sit there? Don't you want to go out there right now, wrestle them to the ground and ask them questions until your throat falls out? What's death like? Does it hurt? Do you still get hungry? Do you miss being alive? Why can you only handle metal objects? Oh, I didn't know I'd noticed that. Okay, so they'll try to kill you, blah, blah, blah. What does that matter? You come back. A bit murder-y, sure, but even so! Calm, Doctor, calm. You were like this when you met Shirley Bassey. Okay. Question one. What is a ghost? Question two. What do they want? 
The Tardis Cloister Bell! 
It must be the ghosts. That's why she was upset when we got here. 
It's just what I was saying. You live and you die. That's it. The ghosts are aberrations. A splinter of time in the skin. They're unnatural. She wants to get away from them. 
Put the handbrake on. 
Whoa! Ho, ho, ho, ho! Where do you think you're going? 
Look, you, er  
Oh, this is my own fault. I like adventures as much as the next man. If the next man is a man who likes adventures. Even so, don't, don't go native. 
Look, there's a whole dimension in here, but there's only room for one me. 
Do you know what you need? You need a hobby.
Or even better, another relationship. Come on, you lot, you're bananas about relationships. You're always writing songs about them, or going to war, or getting tattooed  
I just felt that I, I, I had to say something. 
Because I've got a duty of care. 
So can I stop now? 
They're working out how to use the base against us. Altering the time settings so they can go about uninhibited, opening the airlocks. They're learning. 
Wait, wait.
(sotto) Yes, we're coming back. 
Topside, this is the Doctor, UNIT security visa seven one zero Apple zero zero. You may be familiar with my work. Call back the sub. 
Call it back! We have a hazardous and undefined contagion on board. This base is now under quarantine. 
Well, none of us sent the message, did we? So that means that the ghosts sent it, which means they want that crew down here. 
Well, I don't know, but I'm pretty certain it's not so they can all form a boy band. Okay. We solve this on our own. The ghosts can only come out at night so they change the base's time settings. Why? What's different at night? 
No. Something, something else. 
What systems specifically? 
The answer is in there somewhere, I can smell it. 
O'Donnell. Excellent work, returning the base to day mode. 
Now put it back into night mode. 
We know nothing. We don't know what they want. That's what's getting us killed. Well, I won't run. Not any more. So, O'Donnell, kindly put the base back into night mode. We want to know what these ghosts are after? We ask them. We're going to do the impossible. We're going to capture a ghost. 
Clara, Bennett is going to run across the top of the T-junction to your right 
Lunn, they're coming your way. Clara's going to duck down to her left. You've got to keep the ghosts going on the same route they're on now. 
O'Donnell will close the door once you're through. 
Lunn, don't let them see where you go. 
What? 
Clara, there's a flood door at the end of the corridor, around the corner to your right. We'll close it from here. Listen to me. You've got to get through that door before Moran and the other ghost sees you. 
Now, O'Donnell, fast as you can! 
Now, Lunn, quickly. 
No, no, Lunn. Lunn, can you hear me? Can you hear me? Lunn, what's happening? 
Lunn, can you hear me? Lunn? Lunn? 
What? What's wrong with you? Why didn't it hurt you? Bennett, you're on again. Bennett, where are you? 
Bennett, can you hear me? 
The Faraday cage is across the intersection and down the corridor to your right. This last bit is down to you. 
We need to talk. Sorry, chaps. Just a hologram. You play a little bit too rough. 
Cass, are you seeing this? 
Open the door. 
They don't have any weapons or access to any of the controls. They can't hurt me, so open the door. 
Cold, isn't it? Take away your weapons and you're not so scary, are you? Is that better, Cass? 
What? 
Dark, sword, forsaken, temple. What does that mean? What are you telling me, big man? Bennett! I need maps. I think I just worked out what our friend here is telling us. 
They're coordinates. 
The dark? Space. So, whoever's following the coordinates knows they're going to another planet. The sword? 
Orion's sword. The sword, the three stars, although one isn't actually a star but the Orion Nebula, hanging down from Orion's belt. But if viewed from back here, the Earth becomes the fourth bit of the sword. So, narrowed it down to a planet now. Getting closer.
The forsaken. The forsaken or abandoned or empty town. See, it's a location, beaming out to someone or something across the universe, over and over. And every time they kill one of us  
Get more people down here, kill them, make even more ghosts to beam out the coordinates. 
It could be. Or a warning. Might even be a call to arms. It could mean, come here, they're vulnerable, help yourself. Wait a minute, though. Wait a minuet. Do you know what this means? It means that they're not a natural phenomenon. It means that someone is deliberately getting people killed, hijacking their souls and turning them into transmitters. 
Ah! What the coordinates are for. That is part of the answer to the other question you're all thinking. (blank stares) Really? Come on. None of you? Surely just being around me makes you cleverer by osmosis? What is the other question? 
Finally. It's like pulling teeth. This is the flooded military town. Shops, houses, town square, and this. 
Whatever the coordinates are for, it's in that church. Find that and you're a hop, skip and a jump to stopping them. 
No one has to stay. In fact, I would prefer it if you went. You'll all get in the way and ask ridiculous questions. But, you know, (indicates Cass, Lunn and O'Donnell) you have chosen to protect and serve. (indicates Bennett) You have given yourself to science and the pursuit of knowledge. None of you have chosen anonymous or selfish lives. Go, and a part of you will always wonder, what would have happened if I'd stayed? How could I have helped? What would I have learned? I want you to go. But you should know what it is that you're leaving. 
Something that has the power to raise the dead and turn them into transmitters. I expect we'll know it when we see it. 
That's it, keep going. 
Wait. What's that? Move closer. 
It's the suspended-animation chamber from the spaceship. 
There's something inside there. But it's deadlock sealed. I can't open it. It should be the pilot, it should be. So why do I think it isn't? More questions. Everything I solve, just more questions. I have to go back to the beginning. We arrive, we see the ghosts. They don't kill us. They lead us here, they show us the spaceship. Then they try to kill us. 
Not translated by the Tardis. Why? 
Lunn, translate for me. Whenever I step outside, you are the smartest person in the room. So, tell me, what's weird about this? I know that it's all bonkers but, you know, when you think about it, one thing keeps snagging in your mind. What is it? 
The markings on the inside of the spaceship. Yes! Why? 
They're not. They're magnets. 
Well, a localised and manufactured electromagnetic field, to be precise. The dark. The sword. The forsaken. The temple. When we heard the coordinates for the first time, did anyone expect them not to be that? No, exactly. Me neither. It's like we already knew, somehow. Like the words were already in us. 
Everything we see or experience shapes us in some way. But these words actually rewrite the synaptic connections in your brain. They literally change the way you are wired. Clara, why don't I have a radio in the Tardis? 
And because whatever song I heard first thing in the morning, I was stuck with. Two weeks of Mysterious Girl by Peter Andre. I was begging for the brush of Death's merciful hand. Don't you see? These words are an earworm. A song you can't stop humming, even after you die. 
Waiting for his slash her slash its mates to pick the message up. My God. Every time I think it couldn't get more extraordinary, it surprises me. It's impossible. I hate it. It's evil. It's astonishing. I want to kiss it to death. 
Where's the Tardis? 
We need to get there. It's our only way out. 
I'll get you and the others out. Sit tight, I'll come back for you. 
The Tardis won't go there. It won't go near the ghosts. 
Listen to me. I'm going back in time to when this spaceship landed. If I can understand why this is happening, I can stop them killing anyone else. I can save you. You trust me, don't you, Clara? 
Extremely well. 
Back to before the flood. 
So there's this man. He has a time machine. Up and down history he goes, zip zip zip zip zip, getting into scrapes. 
Another thing he has is a passion for the works of Ludwig van Beethoven. 
And one day he thinks, what's the point of having a time machine if you don't get to meet your heroes? So off he goes to eighteenth century Germany. But he can't find Beethoven anywhere. No one's heard of him, not even his family have any idea who the time traveller is talking about. 
Beethoven literally doesn't exist. This didn't happen, by the way. I've met Beethoven. Nice chap. Very intense. Loved an arm-wrestle. No, this is called the Bootstrap Paradox. Google it. The time traveller panics. 
He can't bear the thought of a world without the music of Beethoven. Luckily he'd brought all of his Beethoven sheet music for Ludwig to sign. So he copies out all the concertos, and the symphonies and he gets them published. He becomes Beethoven. And history continues with barely a feather ruffled. But my question is this. Who put those notes and phrases together? Who really composed Beethoven's Fifth?
Where's Bennett? We need to get going. 
Oh, time travel does that sometimes. 
You seem to know an awful lot about me. 
In anger? 
1980. 
The Minister of War? 
No, never mind. I expect I'll find out soon enough. 
Ah ha. Don't worry. Shall we go? 
Er, we haven't. We're still in Scotland. This is the town before it flooded. The Tardis has brought us to when the spaceship first touched down. But here and now, it's the height of the Cold War. The military were being trained for offensives on Soviet soil. 
No, that's the body. 
This isn't just any spaceship. It's a hearse. 
Yet.
Yes, I've had dealings with your lot before. I can't say I'm a fan. 
What are you doing here? 
He means the planet. 
Listen, we've come from the future. You're about to send some sort of signal. How do you do it? Is it a special pen? 
The technology you use. The thing that wrenches the soul out of the body and makes it repeat your coordinates for eternity. Give it to me now, I'm going to take the batteries out. 
So who sends the message? 
Back to the Tardis. I need to talk to Clara. 
Clara, what's wrong? 
What? Who? Has someone died? 
Yeah. Well, currently. 
It means I die. 
This isn't a potential future. This is the future now.  It's already happened. The proof is right there in front of you. I have to die. 
I can't. Even the tiniest change, the ramifications could be catastrophic. It could spread carnage and chaos across the universe like ripples on a pond. Oh, well, I've had a good innings. (to O'Donnell) This regeneration, it's a bit of a clerical error anyway. (to Clara) I've got to go sometime. 
Clara, I need to talk to you just on your own. 
Listen to me. We all have to face death eventually, be it ours or someone else's. 
I can't change what's already happened. There are rules. 
Clara. 
I can't save Moran or Pritchard. 
I'll do what I can, but the future has already happened. We've just met the Undertaker and he's still alive. 
So. Ghost me. You've got a better view than me. How do I look? Any signs of trauma, any scars? Any clues as to how I die? 
I assume I'm just saying the same thing as the others. 
The mole-faced chap. 
What's the matter, Clara, what's happening? 
What am I doing? 
I'm not trying to kill you? Why am I not trying to kill you? 
I need to talk to me now. 
In a minute. I need to talk to the ghost me. 
Doctor. Such an honour. I've always been a huge admirer. This is really a delight. Finally someone worth talking to. So firstly, why are you here? 
Clara? Clara, what's happening? 
What? 
Clara, now the ghosts are out, go to the Faraday cage. They won't be able to get you in there. Oh, there's a problem. 
The phone signal won't be able to get through. What you'll have to do, Clara, put the phone outside, and you can watch it through the little round porthole. And when you see it ringing, if it's safe to do so, go out and answer it. 
Clara, listen to me. Don't let that phone out of your sight. I need to be able to reach you, I need to know everything my ghost does. Do you understand? I'll come back for you. I swear. 
Come on. Oh, wait a minute. Not you, O'Donnell. 
Someone needs to stay here and mind the shop. What if Clara calls? 
Prentis. Prentis! 
The Fisher King did it himself. The future is still coming. 
He's taken the suspended animation chamber to the church. 
We need to get back to the Tardis. Now! 
It's cut us off. 
No, Bennett! Wait! 
I thought perhaps, because her ghost wasn't there in the future, like Prentis's was, I thought maybe, maybe it wouldn't happen. Maybe she stood a chance. 
Clara. 
This isn't about saving me. I'm a dead man walking. I'm changing history to save Clara. 
Big day for you. Time travel, twice! 
Off the map. Out of the rule book. What if I don't die? What if I refuse? I'm going to go back to the base and I'm going to save Clara, because that's what I do. And I don't see anyone here who's going to stop me. 
Why are we still here? 
No. No, no, no, no, no. 
We've moved half an hour backwards. I'm locked in my own time stream. The Tardis won't let me leave. 
Now we have to keep out of sight, until time catches up. 
LATER Where's Bennett? We need to get going. 
No, he's just not dead yet. And we don't tell him. 
No! 
However that sentence ends, no, we can't. Save him, and you'll want to save O'Donnell. You can't cheat time. I just tried. You can't just go back and cut off tragedy at the root. Because you find yourself talking to someone you just saw dead on a slab. Because then you really do see ghosts. We don't tell him. Understand? Not a word. We don't have that right. 
LATER Yes, I've had dealings with your lot before. I can't say I'm a fan. 
LATER What are you doing here? 
Oh. I need more time. It's too soon. I haven't saved her yet. Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock, tick tock, tick tock. I've got no choice now, I have to face the Fisher King. You, back to the Tardis. 
Now I'm ready. 
I've come from the future. I've seen the chaos you cause. The bloodshed. 
Ghosts. 
Souls wrenched from the dead. Repeating directions to here, to this spot, over and over. 
Four that I know of. Maybe five by now. Probably more since I left. 
What will happen when your people arrive? 
This world is protected, by me. 
You know, you've got a lot in common with the Tivoleans. You'll both do anything to survive. They'll surrender to anyone. You will hijack other people's souls and turn them into electromagnetic projections. That will to endure. That refusal to ever cease. It's extraordinary. And it makes a fella think. Because you know what? If all I have to do to survive is tweak the future a bit, what's stopping me? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. The ripple effect. Maybe it will mean that the universe will be ruled by cats or something, in the future. But the way I see it, even a ghastly future is better than no future at all. You robbed those people of their deaths, made them nothing more than a message in a bottle. You violated something more important than Time. You bent the rules of life and death. So I am putting things straight. Here, now, this is where your story ends. 
I've already done it. The words have gone. I got rid of them. The future I saw, none of that will happen now. The message will never contaminate my friends. No one will die. No one is coming to save you. That's the thing about knowing you're going to die. You've got nothing left to lose. 
HOLO-This is security protocol seven one two. The echelon circuit has been activated. Please stow any hand luggage and prepare for departure. 
Don't kiss me. Morning breath. 
Follow me. 
It's the call of the Fisher King. The call of their master. 
A hologram. Like the one we made of you to lure the ghosts into the Faraday cage. With a soupçon of artificial intelligence, and a few pre-recorded phrases thrown in. 
Ah! 
All beamed from the sonic glasses. 
As soon as you brought me and the chamber on board, it connected with the base's wi-fi and Bob's your uncle, you've got a ghost Doctor. 
Because they're electromagnetic projections that were out of phase with the base's day mode. Right.
That's it. I've erased the memory of the writing. Though you might find you've lost a couple of other memories too. You know, like people you went to school with, or previous addresses or how to drink liquids. That's you two done. Where's Bennett? 
UNIT will cut out the Faraday cage with them inside and take it away. Then the space-hearse will be destroyed, so the writing doesn't infect anyone else. 
I don't understand. 
I need to erase that message from your mind, but it's fine, I'll do it later. 
Drag the cage into space, away from the Earth's magnetic field. With nothing to sustain them, the ghosts will eventually fade away. 
The Fisher King had been dead for a hundred and fifty years before we even got here. But once I went back, I became part of events. But here's the thing. The messages my ghost gave, they weren't for you, they were for me. That list. Everyone after you was random, but you being the next name, that's what made me confront the Fisher King. 
That was me telling me to get inside and when to set it for. 
Except that's not why I said them. 
I programmed my ghost to say them because that's what my ghost had said. And the only reason I created my ghost hologram in the first place was because I saw it here. I was reverse engineering the narrative. 
You do not understand. When did I first have those ideas, Clara? 
Exactly. Who composed Beethoven's Fifth?
In case you think I'm slacking. 
Yes, that's possible, actually. You were too long in the spider mines. 
It's possibly a Love Sprite. Sucks your brain (boom) sucks your brain out through your mouth, hence the name. 
Don't worry, it's just hungry. 
Describe the four most interesting stars you can see. 
Colour of whisky, smaller one blinking? 
Great! I thought asphyxiation would kill you first. Can you see a nebula? Can you see a nebula in a sort of wing-shape? Bit green at the end? 
Great, I've seen it too. I wondered where it was. 
Oh, not a word about my spot-on materialisation skills.
Huh? Oh, yeah. Well, I lured their attackers halfway across the universe and drained their weapons banks. Not to mention, I also saved a school teacher from having her brains devoured and being asphyxiated in deep space. So, now, if you don't mind, I'm going to go outside and wipe my boot on the grass. 
Nothing. But the Velosians will be ready for them this time. It's the best I could do, Clara. I'm not actually the police, that's just what it says on the box. 
We're time travellers. We tread softly. It's okay to make ripples, but not tidal waves. 
Don't say that. 
No, no, not Vikings. I'm not in the mood for Vikings. 
No, I'm not. Do you want to know why? 
On my face, right now, more advanced technology than your species will manage over the next nine million years. 
Clara?
We're going with the Vikings. 
I do have a plan. 
Well, only because you were looking worried. 
I do have a plan. 
Never seen her before in my life. 
I don't know. Nothing, probably. Too much time travel, it happens. 
People talk about premonition as if it's something strange. It's not. It's just remembering in the wrong direction. 
We meet the boss man and we do the usual. 
Replace him. 
To the primitive mind, advanced technology can seem like magic. 
Yeah. It's in my pocket somewhere. 
Magic. 
I am very, very cross with you. I am very disappointed. I have taken human form to walk among you. 
Do you not recognise the sign of Odin?
Oh, and you would know that how, exactly? Have you met Odin? Do you know what Odin looks like? 
Do not believe this foolish trickery! 
It's supposed to do that. 
Stay still. Stay very, very still. 
He hasn't even got a yo-yo. 
Shh. No, this is a harvest. The strongest, the fittest. The weak and young, they'll leave behind. 
We have to not get chosen. 
Clara. Clara, no! 
(sotto) Clara. 
Clara! Clara! 
Oh, stop it! All of you, stop it right now. Homo sapiens, you're an intelligent species. Stop lying to yourselves. 
Yes, I am a false Odin. That's exactly right, I lied. The big fella in the sky, he lied too. You all know it. Because what's the one thing that gods never do? Gods never actually show up! 
Clara? 
Clara! Clara! Clara!
I'm not a hugger. Ahh! Let's hug!
I looked them up in my two thousand year diary. 
They are called the Mire. 
They are one of the deadliest warrior races in the entire galaxy 
But they're practical. They get what they want and go. You persuaded them to go, didn't you? I knew that you would.
One of them, yes. Why? 
What bad luck? You haven't had any bad luck. You're fine. 
Yes, yes, yes, yes. With a whole day to spare! So leave! Hop it, take off! Into the woods, split up, hide. Hang about there for a week, come back home, make puddings and babies. That's basically what you do, isn't it? 
Yes, you can. Just pick a direction. Fly like a bird, run like a nose. That's probably a Viking saying, I haven't checked that. 
Really? Well, I don't know if you remember, but they actually took away all your fighters. So, what are you? Farmers, fishermen, web designers. Maybe not that last one. 
Okay, tell me this. How many people here have actually held a sword in battle? By a show of hands? Mmm hmm. Yeah, baby. 
The Mire are coming for each and every one of you. (throws the sword down again) So what you going to do? Raise crops at them? 
Do babies die with honour? 
I am afraid, Mother. Hold me, Mother. I am afraid.
Turn your face towards me, Mother, for you're, you're beautiful. And I will sing for you. I am afraid, but I will sing. Babies think that laughter is singing. Did you know that? I applaud your courage, but I deplore your stupidity. And I will mourn your deaths, which will be terrifying, painful, and without honour. 
I told you to run. That's all the help you need. And that's all the help you're getting.
The earth is safe, humanity is not in danger. It's just one village. 
Suppose I saved it by some miracle. No Tardis, no sonic. Just one village defeats the Mire. What then? Word gets around. Earth becomes a target of strategic value, and the Mire come back. And God knows what else. Ripples into tidal waves until everybody dies. 
She. She's afraid. Babies sense danger. They have to. 
Mother, I hear thunder. Mother, I hear shouting. You are my world, but I hear other worlds now. Beyond the unfolding of your smile, is there other kindness? I'm afraid. Will they be kind? The sky is crying now. Fire in the water. Fire in the water? 
So, when I say move, you move. When I say jump, you say how high? Unless it's across a gap of some kind which, of course, means you jump horizontally. Yes, what is it, Lofty? 
No, it's not, it's Lofty. I've got too much to think about without everybody having their own names, so it's Lofty. You're Lofty, you're Daphne, (bushy black beard) you're Noggin the Nog, (old man in a too-large helmet) ZZ Top (bushy ginger beard and bald head) and you're er,  Heidi. So, we'll try that again. Lofty, what is it? 
Yes, perhaps you'd like to field this one, Limpy? 
That's right, yes. You'll be given your real swords back when you can prove that you can wave them around without lopping bits off yourselves. Heidi, why are your eyes closed? 
No of course you're not. 
Enough theory. I'm handing out the real swords. 
Well, that could have gone better. 
Morning. 
The Big Bang, dinosaurs, bipeds, and a mounting sense of futility. 
That's not thunder. It's the weapon forges of the Mire. They're making sure we hear them. 
Well, Heidi faints at the mention of blood, not just the sight any more. He's actually upgraded his phobia. Chuckles, (he means Einarr) he questions every single order you give him, which is going to be a little bit difficult, a little bit tricky, in the heat of battle. 
Teaching them to fight, that's the only plan I've got. 
Yeah. I used to believe that too. 
You.  Oh, Clara Oswald what have I made of you? 
They'll die fighting with honour. To a Viking, that's all the difference in the world. 
A good death is the best anyone can hope for, unless you happen to be immortal. 
Night. 
Stop it. 
The human race, you're obsessed. You all need to get a hobby. 
Well, get a new one. 
Tomorrow it's going to be a bloodbath. 
These people all died hundreds of years before you were born 
I have a duty of care. 
Every time we do something like this, I keep thinking, what if something happens to you? 
What? 
What's that? Is that a puppet? Oh, I love puppets! 
Frightened? 
Because if you make up the right story, then you think it will keep them safe and they'll all come home. That's okay. You're not the first person to ever have done that. 
I'm looking for something I'm missing. What do you think our chances are tomorrow? 
Yeah. 
You could go. 
Oh, I like a nice view as much as anyone. 
Can't wait for the next one. 
I will mourn for you. I know which I'd prefer. 
What, you mean the rest of the universe? Basically, yes, I do. 
Good. Good. But that won't save you. 
No. No. No, you go ahead and you cry all you like. Speaking of crying, is that baby getting closer? 
Why has Lofty stolen a baby? 
Oh. Where's he taking her? 
Why would she? Fire in the water. Fire in the water. Fire in the Fire in the water. Fire in the water? Fire in the water! That's it. That's it. That's what I've been missing. Clara, I've found it! 
Clara! Clara! 
Lofty! I had no idea that was your baby. Hello, baby, I had no idea this was your junior parent. 
Chuckles, bedtime is cancelled. Everybody, off the hard stuff. We've got a long night's work ahead of us. I need a blacksmith. Who's the blacksmith? 
You're the blacksmith and you've got a baby too? He's been at it hammer and tongs. 
There's going to be a war tomorrow. And here's some news, this just in. We're going to win the hell out of it. 
Ashildr, this is your village, and you will never have to leave it, I swear. 
I told you that we were basically doomed. Did no one in this two-horn town think to mention that you had eels? 
I give you fire in the water! 
Electric eels! 
Yes, yes! I know exactly how you feel. Well, not exactly. She needs changing. 
And it is a doozy! 
We need to pull that silvery stuff out of Clara's space suit. We can use it to magnify the electrical charge. Stop looking confused! Look happy! Winning is all about looking happier than the other guy. Always walk briskly. Makes you a moving target. Oh, that's for Lofty. Lofty! (he throws something) And talk with confidence, even if you're terrified. 
Act as if you know their plan, and sometimes, if you're very lucky, they'll actually tell you it. Ah, this is for Ashildr. (a blanket) 
Then we deploy the anvil. Now, at this stage, getting me one of their helmets is key. We get a helmet, and this is over. Then we can mop up the rest using Ashildr's monstrosity. 
(grinning) I know. 
Hey, hello, hi! I'm the Doctor. It's lovely to meet you face to er convincing hologram. You could always go zzz and get rid of it, no? No, on second thoughts, don't. That, that, that suits you. 
No, no, no. We decided against that. We thought we'd just have a party! 
We're unarmed. There isn't a single weapon in this room. Which I'm sure your systems are telling you. You wouldn't open fire on unarmed civilians, would you? 
Chuckles, now! 
Run, run, run-run-run-run! That's four down, six left. 
Chuckles, off! 
Reversing the polarity of the neutron flow. I bet that means something. It sounds great. Ashildr! 
Are you ready? 
You were born for this. Show them a story they'll never forget. 
See how they run. 
That's enough, Ashildr. Story's over. Happy ending. 
Ha! Says the man with a fake face. But you see, that's the trouble with viewing reality through technology. It's all too easy to feed in a new reality. 
A story to save a town, and a puppet from a nightmare. You see, you've just seen the world through the eyes of a storyteller. The mighty armies of the Mire. Brutal, sadistic, undefeated. Even I believed the stories. But after today, no one will again. An army like yours, it lives or dies on its reputation, its story. And today, you were sent packing by a handful of farmers and fisherman. Not to mention the whole wetting your pants and running away from a puppet debacle. 
That was hilarious. It's just lucky that nobody recorded that. Oh. Wait a minute, we did. 
The Benny Hill theme, yes. Now, you see, we could just keep this as a funny little film and play it every year at the Christmas party, or I could upload it to the galactic hub and get a second opinion. So the question you need to ask yourself is this. Just how important is your reputation to you? Here's a little sneak preview, piped straight into your helmets, free of charge. 
If you don't leave right now, I'll put it out there for all to see and no one will fear you again. 
Oh, I hacked your teleporter. Sorry. 
I'm sorry. I'm really terribly sorry. 
Yeah. I plugged her into the machine. Used her up like a battery. (sighs) I'm so sick of losing. 
I don't mean the war. I'll lose any war you like. I'm sick of losing people. Look at you, with your eyes, and your never giving up, and your anger, and your kindness. One day, the memory of that will hurt so much that I won't be able to breathe, and I'll do what I always do. I'll get in my box and I'll run and I'll run, in case all the pain ever catches up. And every place I go, it will be there. 
I can do anything. There's nothing I can't do. Nothing. But I'm not supposed to. Ripples, tidal waves, rules.  I'm not supposed to. Oh. Oh! 
My face.  
I think I know why I chose it. 
I think I know what I'm trying to say. 
I know where I got this face, and I know what it's for. 
To remind me. To hold me to the mark. I'm the Doctor, and I save people. 
And if anyone happens to be listening, and you've got any kind of a problem with that, to hell with you! 
It's from the Mire helmet. Battlefield medical kit. I've reprogrammed it for human beings. 
It's repairing her. It will never stop repairing her, if it works. Come on, Ashildr. Come on. The story's not over yet. 
She'll be conscious in a day, up and about in three. No swimming for a week. Now, we're going to need a longboat and some of your best rowers. We're two days' sail from the Tardis. 
Oh, no. Well, she'll, she'll see me often enough once she understands. 
Second dose. 
No, no, no, it's not for her. 
Er, whoever she wants. 
Oh, don't thank me yet, Ashildr. Not yet. 
It won't stop, the repair kit I put inside Ashildr, not ever. It'll just keep fixing her. 
I'm not sure, but it's entirely possible she has lost the ability to die. 
Oh, dying is an ability, believe me. Barring accidents, she may now be functionally immortal. 
Immortality isn't living forever. That's not what it feels like. Immortality is everybody else dying. She might meet someone she can't bear to lose. That happens, I believe. 
I was angry. I was emotional. Just possibly, I have made a terrible mistake. Maybe even a tidal wave. 
Time will tell, it always does. 
Yes. Yes, she did. But Ashildr isn't just human any more. There's a little piece of alien inside her, so in a way, she's. In a way, she's a hybrid. 
Right. 
Warm. 
Warmer. 
Hello. 
Oh, don't mind me, don't mind me. I'm only going to be a minute. Don't worry. Oh, very warm. 
Oh, just ignore me, I'm just passing through, like fish in the night. 
It's not fish in the night, it's something else. 
No, ships in the night. Yeah, something like that. 
Sorry, were you talking to me there? Try again. I promise I'll listen this time. 
Sorry. Sorry, I really was planning to listen that time but, basically, I didn't. Usually, someone hits me at this point, but she's taking the Year 7s for Taekwondo. 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! 
Yes! Got you! (laughs) Oh, hang on. If I didn't know better, I'd say this was a robbery. 
I just need one tiny little thing from out of this box. 
Well, can't we share it? Isn't that what robbery's all about? 
Oh, no! No, no, no, no, no, no! 
No, you bungled mine, Zorro! 
Yeah, well, why don't you show your face? At least I show my face. What's wrong with yours? 
You. 
Old man? 
But didn't you know it was me? 
Yes, I didn't get that impression when you were threatening to kill me. 
It's a very good voice. How do you do that? 
Last time I saw you, you were founding a leper colony. I was so proud of you. 
Yes, I was. You didn't see me, but I saw you. 
Well, you seemed fine. 
Oh, no, this isn't a visit, I've got a job to do. I'm here looking for an alien object which has no business being here on Earth in 1651. It was just, it just so happened, you know, that my tracking device, it led me to the carriage that you were, you know, robbing. There wasn't. I didn't. It was a 
No. It was just a coincidence. 
Oh, Ashildr, I'm sorry. 
You are. That's your name. Ashildr, daughter of Einarr. Chuckles. I used to call him Chuckles. Do you remember? 
You loved that village. 
Anyone in that village would have died for you. 
Ashildr. 
Well, what, what, what do you call yourself? 
Yes, you. There's nobody else here. 
With what? 
It's a big place for someone who lives on their own. 
My curioscanner? Oh, it, er, it sort of scans for, it scans for curios. I've just realising how it got its name. It's been tracking exoplanetary energy for the last couple of weeks. I've been following it across the galaxy. 
I've got a pretty good idea, yes. Why? 
Clearly, you don't need money. So why do you rob? 
A medieval queen? How exciting. 
You're immortal, not indestructible. You can be hurt, killed even. 
How many people have you killed? 
You can't remember? 
The Black Death, 1348. I meant to warn you. 
Of course, your immune system is learning too. There's another bout coming. And a big fire that tears through London. 
No, that was the Terileptils. Surgeon, scientist, inventor, composer, it's a fantastic CV. 
You don't seem the nostalgic type. 
It can't have been easy, outliving the people you love. 
Sorry. 
I do know what it's like. 
How'd you know I had a ship? 
We'll talk about it. 
I don't need your help. 
Tears. 
(reads) Clutching toys as they sleep, never to wake up. My children. My screams. I could not save you, little ones. Such pain. And yet, still, still I am not brave enough to die, to let go of this wretched life. I will endure, but no more babies. I cannot, will not, suffer such heartbreak again. From now on, it's me against the world. 
I read your journals. Why are there pages missing? 
What could be worse than losing your children? 
I've left you alone too long. I had no idea how much you'd suffered. But I remember the person you used to be. She's still in there. I can help you find her. 
I think this is just another mask that you wear to protect you from the pain. 
This is no way to live your life, de-sensitised to the world. 
How do you know? How do you know what I usually do? We've met once in a Viking village. I didn't give you my life story. 
Oh, who told you that? 
Not for me. Sonic technology. It should be able to deactivate any alarms. 
Now is not the time to be showing off. 
Brought my own, thanks. 
Why are you still alone? What happened to the second immortality charge I gave you? 
Humans need 
Humans need shared experiences. 
It isn't right for you to be on your own! 
The Eyes of Hades. 
(sotto) Let's just go round and see if we can't get out the back.
What are you doing? 
No, we can't. We should hide. 
You're the liability. I never have this trouble with Clara. 
Oh, you remember Clara, do you? 
There's nothing wrong with her. 
Well, look how you turned out. 
Save your breath. 
Older than you. 
Robbery, burglary, that's capital. Meat and drink to the hangman, Ashildr. 
No, not the puns. Line in the sand. No puns. 
This is banter. I'm against banter. I'm on record on the subject of banter. 
We could give you cash instead. 
I'm not his dad, I'm the Doctor. 
What, says Sam Swift the Quick? That's trying a bit too hard, isn't it? Or are you a little bit slow? 
I rest my case. No-one outwits the Knightmare. 
Good question. 
Also can you confirm that I'm not your dad? 
Kill him and you make an enemy of me. 
I know their lives are short, I understand, but those lives do matter. 
I have a theory about the amulet. 
The Doctor. 
You keep him on. See, you do have a heart. You don't fool me. 
Pink. Are you coming down with something? Look, why would an alien artefact resemble the Eyes of Hades, King of the Underworld? 
An ancient Greek talisman which wards off evil and protects those in death on their journey to an afterlife? 
Could it be that the mythology originated on another planet? 
No. I think I want to stick around, and keep an eye on you for a while. 
Well, why not? Hey, we're a good team. 
You don't want to get stuck with an old fool like me. You have this whole wonderful planet to play on. 
In the future, you'll fly. 
Because it wouldn't be good. Ashildr, please. Ashildr. 
Do you have a cat? It sounds like a very big cat. Hence the very big cat flap. 
If somebody needed my help, why did nobody just ask? I am forced to assume you have plans I wouldn't approve of. Oh, Ashildr. 
Kill me! 
If you intend any harm to this planet or its people, then killing me is by far your best move. 
Then tell me why you are here and what you intend to do. Otherwise, get on with trying to kill me. But I advise you. Be very quick and very sure. 
Using the amulet? That was your means of travel. 
The Underworld, gateway to an afterlife, another reality. 
Oh! Oh, so what's the plan, Ashildr? Fancy yourself as his new Queen? Hunting, running errands while he sleeps. 
Oh, what? And you think you can trust him? 
So do I. 
I'm looking for the headline here. 
Well, you know, you want to escape? Well, go on. Escape as much as you like. Why would I not approve? 
What about it? 
Of course. Every single death is a tiny fracture in reality, and the amulet can lever the fracture open. Primitive, but effective. 
So who dies so you can run away? 
No, you can't. He loves you. 
Oh, Ashildr, daughter of Einarr, what happened to you? 
I know you've suffered. Your children dying. 
I do, now, but 
Why should I be responsible for you? 
I saved your life. I didn't know that your heart would rust because I kept it beating. I didn't think your conscience would need renewing, that the well of human kindness would run dry. I just wanted to save a terrified young woman's life. 
Look, I don't know what Lenny the Lion is up to, but I know his type. Very first argument, guaranteed he'll bite your head off. 
You're playing with fire. Open that portal and you have no idea what horrors might come through. 
You're not like this. I know you're not. 
He'll kill you. 
No, listen, I was trying to help her. She tied 
In which case, don't do it. 
Do I look like some feckless thief? I'm on your side. I'm an undercover constable from Scotland Yard. Do you have Scotland Yard yet? 
The Dunbar Victory medal. I was decorated for valour in battle. 
All I want is to bring the Knightmare to justice. 
I came to warn her. I fear her life is in danger. 
Look! It's the Knightmare, cloaked and in disguise, bound for Tyburn. You have to let me go, or take me there. 
Well, will you take me there if I say yes? 
Twenty pounds? Is that all? 
Well, in that case, I know where Lady Me keeps all of her money. Almost thirty pounds. 
Sorry, yes. Sorry about the horse! Excuse me! 
Sorry, excuse me. Excuse me! Sorry! 
Have you taken anything for it? 
Quick man, I'm running out of patients! 
I'm no one's sidekick. 
And his nose is so big that 
Or, or bury him in a pyramid. 
Big handkerchief! 
Wait! I have a pardon here for Sam Swift from Cromwell himself. 
No! Ashildr, no! No!
Purple, the colour of death. His life force is opening a portal. 
Or to Hell. 
Doors work both ways. They let people out and they let the enemy in. 
Space ships, or they will be. They're coming through the rift, actualising in this plane of reality. 
Ashildr! He doesn't care. 
It's awful, isn't it? It's infuriating. You think you don't care, then you fall off the wagon.
Welcome back. 
Okay. Okay. Er. Eyes of Hades. Afterlife. Death opens up a gateway. We need to close it. 
Sam Swift, he's the conduit. The amulet, it's still in him. It's his death that's opening the rift. So what do we do? 
Run! 
Yeah, I could tell. Gave a whole new meaning to dying on stage. 
Do you want him to be? 
Well, probably not. Probably the power would have been drained by the whole opening and reversing the portal thingy. There'll be enough power to bring him back, but not enough power to keep him here, probably. 
Yeah. But it's hard to keep track of all this stuff. Keep an eye on him though. He might be around for a while. Or not. Who can say? 
People like us, we go on too long. We forget what matters. The last thing we need is each other. We need the mayflies. See, the mayflies, they know more than we do. They know how beautiful and precious life is because it's fleeting. Look how Sam Swift made every last moment count, right to the gallows. Look how glad he is to be alive. I looked into your eyes and I saw my worst fears. Weariness. Emptiness. 
You're not the first, you know. I did travel with another immortal once. Captain Jack Harkness. 
He'll get round to you eventually. Who told you about me? The man who comes for the battle and runs away from the fallout. 
Sometimes tidal waves. 
Well, you should be. You're an extraordinary woman, Ashildr. But I think I'm going to have to keep an eye on you. 
No? 
So are we enemies now? 
Ashildr, I think I'm very glad I saved you. 
Oh, hello! Hi. 
Be more specific. Who are you? 
Why? Am I ill? 
Are you ill? 
Are you never going to travel with me again, because I said a thing? 
Oh, well that's a relief. 
That was her fault because she should have stressed imaginary. 
Yes, you're right. That is not a good present. 
Do they make sherbet lemons any more? And I'd like a Ferrari. What about a Ferrari? 
Okay, come on, let me see, let me see. Let me see, let me see. 
Nothing. Nothing at all. 
Tell her next time, I'll take cash. 
Wherever you want. 
Ah, there is nowhere new under the sun. Above it, on the other hand. 
I've missed you, Clara Oswald. 
Hello, it's Doctor Disco. I'm in the twenty first century. I don't know what month. I'm staking out some of the most dangerous creatures imaginable. 
Operating under deep cover. Trying not to attract suspicion. Give me a call, Clara. Nightmare Scenario. I'm worried. 
Okay. Hey, Monster High and Cinderella. Down off the monkey bars. Listen to me. We've got to talk. 
Look, I admire you, okay? I think you're ingenious. Pretending to be a couple of seven year  olds is a splendid way to conceal your blobbiness. But let's not pretend. You're very blobby. In fact, you two are the big blobs. And you are not patrolling the ceasefire. 
Fine. Fine, bury your heads. Listen to me. Listen! There are other factions. I know that there are other blobby factions that you don't control. They're planning something. And if we don't get together and stop it, it'll be the end of this. Of all of you.
Your kids are out of control. I'm taking this out of your hands.
Don't even think about going anywhere. 
Are you phoning me with your backside again, or are you really sending me a distress signal?
Hey! Away! Away! Get those kids out of the way! Out of the way! Out of the way! Out of the way! Move! Out of the way!
Call me now.
Yes, I know. It's called peace. What about the two little girl commanders? Weren't they helping you?
The Zygon command centre. That's the control polyp for all Zygons on Earth.
Could you? Would you mind? Thank you. 
If this has been compromised, the Zygons are wide open. They'll be starting to panic. Starting to worry.
It's a command computer. You operate it by titivating the fronds.
I snogged a Zygon once. Old habits.
Still got the old magic.
Both of them.
Both of them. They would have maintained a live link. They were both Zygon and human at the same time. They not only administered the peace, they were the peace. 
Ah ha! Okay. Zygons hatched and dispersed all over, but something's gone wrong. Mexico border, North Asia, West Africa, Australia. Panic. Paranoia. What would happen if they knew who we were?
So, we have a Zygon revolution on our hands. We need to open negotiations.
Isn't there a solution that doesn't involve bombing everyone?
This is a splinter group. The rest of the Zygons, the vast majority, they want to live in peace. You start bombing them, you'll radicalise the lot. That's exactly what the splinter group wants.
Okay. Kate Stewart, no bombs for you. Go to Truth Or Consequences. See what you can find out. The Doctor will go to Turmezistan. Negotiate peace, rescue Osgood, and prevent this war, cos that's what he does. Clara, Jac, you stay here. This is your country. Protect it from the scary monsters. And also from the Zygons. 
Oh, and do you still have the presidential aircraft?
No, but I like poncing about in a big plane.
At ease. I'm the President of the World. I'm here to rescue people and generally establish happiness all over the place. The Doctor. Doctor Funkenstein.
What's going on here? Fun and games?
You're not bombing that town. That's where they're holding my friend.
Colonel.
Well, that's interesting. 
So, that's what we'll find out.
Colonel, take it easy. They're trying to unsettle you. They're trying to make you paranoid and panicked.
This is our object. We need to get her back, safely. Try to kill as few of them as possible. I need have to have someone to negotiate with.
This is pointless! Just let me go in and talk!
Where are the Zygons?
I'm not going to let you do that.
I need to find Osgood.
Osgood! Osgood! 
Osgood!
Osgood!
Osgood! 
Osgood! 
Got to get you out. They're going to bomb this place. What do the Zygons want?
Rescuing you. In quite a dashing way, I might add.
Clara.
Oh, hello.
They've started. So much for ten minutes. 
Can you change your voicemail message, please, it's getting very boring.
Oh, I see you've accessorised it.
The old question marks.
Oh, I know, yes, I did. 
Oh, I do. I've got question mark underpants. 
Which one are you? Human or Zygon?
Why not?
Like a hybrid.
Well, I'm proud to know you, Osgood. And I promise that I won't tell anyone that you're a human. Zygons need to keep the human original alive to refresh the body print. If you were a Zygon, you'd've changed back within days of your sister's death.
Bit of first-things-first-ness. What's your name? My name's. Well, you can call me the Doctor. But then you knew that, didn't you? You want something. What is it?
I suppose so.
Well, you can't have the United Kingdom. There's already people living there. They'll think you're going to pinch their benefits.
Really. Clara?
Clara? 
And apparently my plane is never going to land, but let's see what we're going to do about that. 
Clara!
Missed! 
Any questions? 
Er, camouflage. 
Yes, we're in Britain. Oh, your specs are broken. I'll fix them. You can wear mine, they're sonic. 
Yeah.
What's wrong with pointless? I once invented an invisible watch. Spot the design flaw. 
Don't look at my browser history. 
Yeah, I said don't. 
She did blow us up with her big bazooka. This is us being blown up with a big bazooka. 
Thanks. 
Again, thank you. 
Ah, yes. Why limit yourself? You've really thought this through, haven't you? 
Yes. 
I don't know. I'm still in the hope phase. 
Hell. Please talk about something else. 
Don't think of them as rational. They're different. They don't care about human beings, they don't care about their own people. They think the rest of Zygonkind are traitors. 
It's a splinter group. 
The Zygon who probably killed her. Read it. 
What does that mean? A political awakening? Why would she be sending me propaganda? She just blew me up with a big bazooka. 
She was amazing. 
How? 
Texting? 
You don't know. It's just a theory. 
Worse than ever. 
Hello! Hi! Hello. 
Doctor John Disco. It was my plane. I had a big plane for purposes of er, poncing about. 
It went off with a massive bang about half a mile that way? Actually, er, It's fine. We're, we're fine, aren't we? 
Yes, yes, yes, we're fine. Just, er, move along. (quietly to Osgood) Come on.
Hello. 
Yes, well, I'm dead now, and I think I might be a bit more dead in a minute. What's your plan, Zygella? 
Come on, you don't invade planets without having kind of plan. That's why they're called planets, to remind you to plan it? Hey, hey! That's good! Pun-tastic. Doctor Pun-tastic! Oh, come on, that was a good one, Zygella! 
And you're winking at me. 
You do know what winking means? You're sending out some very mixed messages here. You know I'm over two thousand years old? I'm old enough to be your Messiah. 
We need some wheels. The van! 
Okay. Non-verbal communication. I assume that you never bothered to learn Morse code. (sotto) Specs! Setting 137.
Okay, we'll have to try something else. Twenty questions. Where's your pod? Is it in a tunnel? Is it in London? 
Thanks very much. Gotcha! 
Stay where you are, Clara. We're coming to get you. And for God's sake, don't let her into your memories.
Obviously. 
The mind of Clara Oswald. She may never find her way out. (he chuckles.)
Dazzling, isn't it? 
Ah, London. Perpetual city, cradle of culture, here we come! Clara, stay safe. 
London! What a dump. 
No, it's not, it's a dump. 
I spend an awful lot of time being kidnapped, tortured, shot at and exterminated. Doesn't mean I like it. 
There's electricity in the air. 
What's your name? 
No, no, no. Your first name? 
Basil. 
Let's just, er, stick with what we had. I need to ask you, because it's important, because it might matter. 
Which one are you? Human or Zygon? 
: We can help you. 
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. It's okay, it's okay. 
Please! Come back! Come back! 
I can't help you just now, but 
I understand. 
We're on your side. 
Listen, we are not them. 
No, no, no! Stop! Stop! Stop,
There it is, Osgood. There's their plan. 
Unmask everyone, provoke fear, paranoia, provoke a war. 
Kate! Are you all right? 
It's just I'd heard otherwise. 
Well, how very convenient, because that's just exactly what we're looking for. 
Well, they like a good cave, don't they? How many of these pods are occupied? 
Which one is Clara's? 
Oh, you cheeky little monkeys! 
Two Osgoods, two boxes. Operation Double. What did you expect? 
One box normalises all the Zygons. 
Destroys them. 
Ah, that would be telling.
No. This is war. You pull the trigger, you pay the price. 
The blue one! The blue one! The blue one normalises all your people. 
No, I'm not. And when you open up the box, you'll see I'm not lying. 
Yeah, I know. 
You're you.
How did you survive? 
Why does peacekeeping always involve killing? 
Is this the lot? 
Twenty million Zygons about to be unmasked. You don't know whether they are human or not. And you can't fight them, not with soldiers. 
Oh, I was really hoping that it wouldn't. 
Well, you know how it is. Daddy knows best.
Let me negotiate peace. You can't commit mass murder
The boxes are safeguards for both species. You agreed to that. 
Yes, you did, then I wiped your memory. And you agreed to that, too. But that's why there were two Osgoods to police the ceasefire. One human and one Zygon, to keep the secrets and keep the peace. 
Hi! Hello! Hello! 
Oh, hello! Hi. Hi. Stop this. Stop this, please. Let me take both of these boxes away. We'll forgive, we'll forget. And the ceasefire will stand. 
This is the moment we've all been waiting for. Make your mind up time! 
: One of those buttons will destroy the Zygons, release the imbecile's gas. The other one detonates the nuclear warhead under the Black Archive. It'll destroy everyone in London. Bonnie. Bonnie, sweetheart! One of those buttons will unmask every Zygon in the world. The other one cancels their ability to change form. It'll make them human beings for ever. (normal) There are safeguards beyond safeguards. I did this on a very important day for me and this ceasefire will stand. 
No, it's not. 
No, I'm not. 
No. 
No, it's not. It's your fault. 
So did I. 
So what.
So's everyone. 
Oh, it's not fair! Oh, I didn't realise that it was not fair! Well, you know what? My Tardis doesn't work properly and I don't have my own personal tailor. 
These things have happened, Zygella. They are facts. You just want cruelty to beget cruelty. You're not superior to people who were cruel to you. you're just a whole bunch of new cruel people. A whole bunch of new cruel people being cruel to some other people, who'll end up being cruel to you. The only way anyone can live in peace is if they're prepared to forgive. Why don't you break the cycle? 
What is it that you actually want? 
Ah. Ah, right. And when this war is over, when you have a homeland free from humans, what do you think it's going to be like? Do you know? Have you thought about it? Have you given it any consideration? Because you're very close to getting what you want. What's it going to be like? Paint me a picture. Are you going to live in houses? Do you want people to go to work? Will there be holidays? Oh! Will there be music? Do you think people will be allowed to play violins? Who's going to make the violins? Well? Oh, you don't actually know, do you? Because, like every other tantrumming child in history, Bonnie, you don't actually know what you want. So, let me ask you a question about this brave new world of yours. When you've killed all the bad guys, and when it's all perfect and just and fair, when you have finally got it exactly the way you want it, what are you going to do with the people like you? The troublemakers. How are you going to protect your glorious revolution from the next one? 
Oh, will you? Well, maybe, maybe you will win! But nobody wins for long. The wheel just keeps turning. So, come on. Break the cycle. 
Because I want to get you to see, and I'm almost there! 
And we're off! Fingers on buzzers! Are you feeling lucky? Are you ready to play the game? Who's going to be quickest? Who's going to be luckiest? 
No, it's not a game, sweetheart, and I mean that most sincerely. 
Because it's not a game, Kate. This is a scale model of war. Every war ever fought, right there in front of you. Because it's always the same. When you fire that first shot, no matter how right you feel, you have no idea who's going to die! You don't know whose children are going to scream and burn! How many hearts will be broken! How many lives shattered! How much blood will spill until everybody does until what they were always going to have to do from the very beginning. Sit down and talk! (sigh) Listen to me. Listen, I just, I just want you to think. Do you know what thinking is? It's just a fancy word for changing your mind. 
Then you will die stupid. Alternatively, you could step away from that box, you can walk right out of that door and you could stand your revolution down. 
You're all the same, you screaming kids. You know that? Look at me, I'm unforgivable. Well, here's the unforeseeable. I forgive you. After all you've done, I forgive you. 
I don't understand? Are you kidding? Me? Of course I understand. I mean, do you call this a war? This funny little thing? This is not a war! I fought in a bigger war than you will ever know. I did worse things than you could ever imagine. And when I close my eyes I hear more screams than anyone could ever be able to count! And do you know what you do with all that pain? Shall I tell you where you put it? You hold it tight till it burns your hand, and you say this. No one else will ever have to live like this. No one else will have to feel this pain. Not on my watch! 
Thank you. Thank you.
I know. I know. Thank you. (to Clara-Z) Well? 
Of course. And do you know how you know that? Because you've started to think like me. 
:It's hell, isn't it? No one should have to think like that. And no one will. Not on our watch. (their eyes meet) Gotcha.
Because you have a disadvantage, Zygella. I know that face. 
No, well, er, you've said that the last fifteen times. 
No. Just Kate's. Oh, and your little friend's here, of course. (the Zygons) When they wake up, they won't remember what you've done. It'll be our secret. 
Because I've been where you have. There was another box. I was going to press another button. I was going to wipe out all of my own kind, man, woman and child. I was so sure I was right. 
The same thing that happened to you. I let Clara Oswald get inside my head. Trust me. She doesn't leave. 
The Tardis. 
What? You're kidding me? Surely you know that? 
I made it up from the initials. It stands for Totally And Radically Driving In Space. Do you want to come? All of the future, all of history, and all of the universe? 
Fair enough. Clara, would you mind er
I'll see you in the Tardis, okay? 
I need to know. Which one are you? 
Human or Zygon? 
(stuttering) But I don't, I don't. How, how?
Zygella? 
But which one of you
You're a credit to your species, Petronella Osgood. 
Oh, and you should know. I'm a very big fan. 
Yeah. 
Longest month of my life. 
I'll be the judge of time.
They never put the word space in front of something just because everything's all sort of hi-tech and future-y. It's never space restaurant or space champagne or space, you know, hat. It's just restaurant, champagne or hat.
Even if this was a restaurant
Pedant.
Hello. 
Yes. Yes, we are.
We're here to, er. 
Stress. 
From the beginning of time? That's a very long story. 
Well. Well, we just arrived, you know, and there was nobody about. What are you doing here?
Theories?
So, what, you are a rescue mission? 
Of four? 
(sings) ? Part of the furniture! ?
Okay. Really? 
(sotto) Okay.
Indo-Japanese.
Thirty eighth century. (tastes his finger again.) Tuesday. 
Hmm. After the Great Catastrophe, there was a tectonic realignment. India and Japan, they were sort of merged.
Well, you've got all that to look forward to, haven't you? Mind you, this place looks as if it's been dead for a long while now. 
What is it?
She's a Grunt, Clara. They're bred in hatcheries. Cloned muscles. Low intelligence. Brute force. Instant army.
Well, that's how they roll in the thirty eighth century.
(sotto) Hold my hand.
I'm not.
Oh, run, run, run! Run! Run! 
Quick! Push anything in front of it! We've got to keep them out! 
Not pirates. 
Where's your friend?
Finding out what they're made of.
Organic. Definitely organic. Blood cells. Skin cells. Mucus.
I could take a look at that. You know, triangulate the signal, help you find your friend.
Clara!
Clara! 
What did you think you were doing?
Are you okay? 
Semi-sentient. It thinks it knows what's good for you. You obviously needed forty winks. Clever little sleep pod. You said it was something more than that, though. 
(to camera) Well, let's just say, for the sake of argument, that we don't. What is Morpheus? 
Oh, no. No, no. enough of that. 
It's almost like someone's
Sleep-deprivation pods?
But sleep is 
Sleep is vital. Sleep is wonderful. Even I sleep. 
Well, when you're not looking. 
So, how does it work?
Are they now? Sleep, that knits up the ravelled sleeve of care. The death of each day's life, sore labour's bath. Balm of hurt minds, chief nourisher in life's great feast. Congratulations, Professor. You've revolutionised the labour market. You've conquered nature.
You've also created an abomination.
Sleep dust. 
Well do I look like I'm kidding? Is this a kidding face? Ask the crew of this station if they're kidding. Or what's left of them.
Yes. The stuff in the corner of your eye. The stuff you wipe away every morning when you wake up. 
Well, when we sleep, the mucus crust builds up in our eyes. Blood cells, skin cells. That's what dust largely is. Human skin. But your meddling has evolved it. Hot-housed it. What used to be sleep in your eye has turned into a carnivorous life form. 
Lying there in those pods, people are a ready-made food source. 
Digested.
Well, my guess is that the ones you're using are pretty primitive compared to what's going on up here. These are a sort of a Mark Two, yeah?
You've succeeded there.
You saw what happened. The dust conglomerates and moulds itself into humanoid form. It's adaptable. It's clever.
And it's coming for us.
No. We can't leave this place until there's not a trace of the dust or your machines left. Or that's it for your lot. 
Oh, the human race.
Nagata! That thing, the schematic. Give it to me! 
Me? I'm in charge. 
No, but I'm in charge. I can bypass the main systems and reboot the grav-shields! 
Don't say it. Please don't say it!
Hang on!
I can do this! I can fix this!
The G-force is increasing the closer we get to the planet! Hold on! 
We're back online! Grav-shields fixed! We're rising! Go. let's get out of here! Go, go! Out of here. Come on! 
Keep going, move it, move it, move it! 
Nagata!
I don't know. 
Don't be ridiculous. 
To die? They wouldn't thank you for that. Nor you, Clara. To die, to die. Glamis hath murdered sleep, therefore Cawdor shall sleep no more. Macbeth shall sleep no more. 
Shakespeare. He really knew his stuff. They all did. The Ancients. The poets. All those sad songs. All those lullabies. Sleep is essential to every sentient being in the universe. But to humans. Greedy, filthy, stupid humans. It's an inconvenience to be bartered away. Well, now we know the truth. Sleep isn't just a function. It's blessed. Every night we dive deep into that inky pool, deep into the arms of Morpheus. Every morning, we wake up and wipe the sleep from our eyes, and that keeps us safe. Safe from the monsters inside.
I've hacked into your helmet cams. 
Reviewing the footage. There's something not right here. 
Why did it kill Rassmussen like that?
But that's a direct attack. That's not how they operate. Dust grows. Consumes the host.
Maybe. There's something going on here. Something we're not getting.
Sandmen?
No, you don't get to name things. I'm the Doctor. I do the naming.
It's like the Silurians all over again.
Sandmen. (to Nagata) What did you just say? 
One point eight three minutes ago. 
We let them in.
We let them in.
Run! Engine room! 
You said you felt like you were being watched, Clara. 
Not this time. 
There is a feed. Wireless. These images are being stored by someone. Collated. Nagata, look at this footage. What's wrong with it? What's wrong with it? 
Look, there's one very obvious thing about it. Do you see it yet? No? Okay, I'll tell you what's wrong. There's footage here of everyone. But what's missing in all of it? What can't you see anywhere? Not in the footage, not on this ship. Look. Really look. There are no cameras here. No CCTV. No helmet cams. So, how and why does this footage even exist? The dust has been watching us. Each little organic speck, just a tiny spy drifting through the air. The monsters have been with us all along. That's why the Sandmen are blind. Their visual receptors are being hijacked. But by whom, and why? And then, there's this.
That's you, Clara. That's you, looking at me.
You went into the pod. The Morpheus process has begun.
There's nothing here from Chopra's point of view because he refuses to use Morpheus. But everybody else is here. Including you. You don't have a camera, Clara. But you will have by now, sleep in your eye.
Yes. I'm sure it'll be fine. I'm sure you'll be fine. 
We will sort this, Clara. We'll sort you. We'll sort Nagata, and everyone back on Triton. And then we will destroy Morpheus forever. 
Well, there was that incident with the grav-shields, but. Ah. 
The grav-shields didn't fail. They were deliberately powered down.
Well, that's not their style, is it? 
It's like, it's like something's been kept here, near the engines, where it's hot. Like something's being kept alive.
Yeah. 
I have an idea who. A very nasty idea.
Because that's where he'll be. 
You had that prepared well in advance, didn't you? Your statement. Your alibi. There would inevitably be questions when you got to Triton. So, you needed to get your story straight. 
I think the Professor has been playing a long game. Am I right? 
You and your cargo.
It's like smuggling a jam jar full of germs through customs. 
What do you mean?
Or what's left of him. 
You know I can't allow that.
What he wants is to get that thing off this ship. We have to stop him. 
The doors are not a problem.
We need a distraction.
When I say run, run.
Hey! Sandy!
Run! 
Doors! 
Rassmussen! Turn off the engines. Shut this ship down! 
No! 
He's not the only one dead. According to this data, we're the only ones left alive on this station. 
This doesn't make any sense. 
A man who hasn't slept for five years?
But the dust consumes the host.
We escaped from that cold storage room because they were blind.  And why power down the grav-shields when he did?  It's like this is all for effect.
Like a story.
Alternative transport. 
We have to get to Triton, destroy all the Morpheus machines. End this. This is how we get home? 
Nagata!
Self-destructed the grav-shields. 
It's working!
Neptune's gravity is pulling them apart, bit by bit! It doesn't make sense. None of this makes any sense.
It very nearly ate you for dinner. 
It wasn't going to eat me. 
The second most beautiful garden in all of time and space, and we can never come back here because you, Miss Oswald, decided 
Who said you could give out my number? 
Did you make this human? 
She's better than that. She's brilliant. What are you doing running round getting tattoos when there's 
Okay, show me this tattoo that you didn't get, then. 
It's a tattoo. It's very boring. 
Oh, that's not boring. That is very not boring. 
Okay, Local Knowledge, you're coming with us. Bring the new human. No, don't bring the new human. I'll just get distracted. 
If you want your extremities to stay attached, stand absolutely still. If not, we can provide a small bag, you can take them home at the end. 
Oh. Right, okay, here we go. Ah Good. Weird. Good and weird. 
Er, oh, yes, yes. Of course. First off. In the last twenty four hours, you have had significant contact with alien lifeforms, right here in the centre of London. 
You've been retconned. 
Amnesia drug. 
Your pre-frontal cortex is marinating in it. Ooo, there's something else. Something. Er, not good. Weird. 
There is no nice way to say you're about to die. 
Rigsy 
Okay. Okay. Yes, okay, let's do this thing. First up, stop the countdown. Five hundred and twenty six minutes. Right. Okay. Yes, you know what, Local Knowledge, I don't know who did this to you or why. But I do almost certainly know how to find them. 
There have always been rumours, stories passed from traveller to traveller. Mutterings about hidden streets. 
Secret pockets of alien life right here on Earth. Like a smuggler's cove, only not a cove, because it's right here, right in the middle of the capital. 
No. The maps are. 
I never put stock in it. London streets that suddenly disappeared from human view? No. You lot are always overlooking things, but whole streets? That would be excessive, even for you. If the stories are true, though, there should be a street on one of these old maps that no longer exists in the real world. 
What did you say? 
My God. A whole London street just up and disappeared and you lot assume it's a copyright infringement. 
We're looking for a trap street and we're not going to find it here. 
The glasses are tracking your eye movements. Just keep looking straight down and 
Whatever they're using, it only hides the street itself. It prevents you from noticing there's even something missing. They're somehow making our eyes skate right over it. Let's call it a misdirection circuit. 
Tell me about it. It's an ongoing problem. Here. 
Keep it steady. Just move it slowly over the grid. When we're done, we'll have a map of the areas of the grid that Clara couldn't focus on. 
Okay, we split up. Clara, that way. (she walks off) Local Knowledge. (another direction)  Forget the way you usually look at the world. This street's going to be hiding in plain sight. 
Seventy nine, eighty, eighty one, eighty two. 
Remember. Eighty two. 
Clara! Clara! Clara! 
We're very close. We need to distract our other senses. Clara, go back to the Tardis. Pick up all my most annoying stuff. 
What happened to the stuff I asked you to bring? 
What is it? What are you remembering? 
Fifty minutes left. Hoodie up, Local Knowledge. They know what you look like in there. 
You were upset, weren't you? Something slipped through the retconned memory. Something that took over your whole mind. Something juicy. So the misdirection circuit lost its power over you. 
Well, perhaps they do 
Asylum? 
Yeah, of course. 
That's your name. I keep telling you that. 
It's professional interest. 
Still saving the world from me, then? 
I saw you. 
Yes, you did, and you have. Now we need your help. Someone in this place is in control of a Quantum Shade. 
You. 
What have you done? 
You flooded his brain with retcon! Till we showed up, he didn't even know that he had to say goodbye. 
Ashildr, given we're all going to forget this conversation anyway, perhaps you could tell us what happened here yesterday to necessitate a death sentence? 
No. You've already endangered one of my friends. I want your personal guarantee that you will not endanger another. 
So you're still calling yourself Me, then? 
Mayor Me. 
Difficult, isn't it? 
How long have you been here? 
The battle? 
This misdirection circuit of yours is remarkable. The cloaking device that hides the street, makes everyone look like humans. 
Aiee ah!
Yes, a phrase I find is usually followed by a lot of screaming and running and bleeding. 
She's a Janus. 
The child. A daughter? 
No, it's not bad, it's just unhelpful. A daughter might've seen who killed her mother. 
The female Janus is psychic. One face sees into the future, the other looks behind her, into the past. 
You didn't just wander in here. You were called here at 6am by a number from a mystery phone. 
Yes. Please, go. It's not like we've got a ticking clock or anything. 
Forty one minutes. 
It's called a Quantum Shade. It's kind of a spirit. Once it's bound to a victim 
You could flee across all of time and all of the universe, it would still find you. 
At least give him a merciful death. 
No, no, no, we don't have. Can I not be the good cop? 
Oh, yes. Well, forget about cops, right? Forget about finding the real killer. You heard Ashildr. All we have to do is persuade these creatures that it isn't Rigsy. And fast. 
Are you sure it wasn't someone from the street? 
I've identified twenty seven different species on this street so far, fifteen of whom are known for aggression. Why is it so hard to believe that one of them is capable of murder? 
Why not? What's so special about her? 
So you just want the human dead, is that it? 
So you'll just let Rigsy die? 
A what? 
Shut up! Shut up. The other thing you said, the second thing. What, what, what, you said he was scared and? 
Shh. Did he say a doctor or the doctor? This is very, very important. 
Clara gave you my number for emergencies. So when you wake up with a weird tattoo on your neck and no memory of the last twenty four hours, the first thing you do is call the Doctor. 
But you find yourself accused of murder on a strange alien street in the middle of London. Only they've taken your phone, so you beg the woman in charge to call me instead. She knew you and I were friends. So why'd she lie? Unless she had something to hide. 
There's something very wrong here and we're running out of time. 
The Mayor. What is she up to? It's nothing good, is it? 
They usually do. If what Ashildr is doing is harmless, then we'll just walk out of that door. No one will know of your abilities. But if it's not 
This isn't about Rigsy. It's about me. 
Afraid of what? Of whom? 
You hold your tongue. We've got ten minutes left! 
Ashildr said Anah was being taken home for burial. But the Janus burn their dead. 
There's something about this tech 
It looks like medical data. 
This thing's a stasis pod. If you're dead, it's a kind of fancy refrigerator. But if you're alive 
It simply keeps you that way. 
She's alive. 
There must be a way to unlock it. Something basic, something simple that I'm missing. 
A keyhole would be very handy, yes, but I haven't got one.
No, Anahson, stay here. There's a reason that the Mayor has gone AWOL. She means for us to release your mother, but she doesn't want us to use her key. She wants to use mine. 
This girl needs her mother. Ah!
I can't 
There are easier ways to steal a key, you know. 
What is this, Ashildr? You can't possibly think this is going to keep me here. 
Where are you sending me? 
They? Who are they? 
In your terms, my last will and testament. 
I've no idea. 
Clara, you didn't! 
Who told you to give it to her? 
What exactly did Rump say? 
But what? 
No. (to Ashildr) But you can. Fix this. Fix it now. 
Yes, it is, you can, and you will, or this street will be over. I'll show you and all your funny little friends to the whole laughing world. I'll bring UNIT, I'll bring the Zygons. Give me a minute, I'll bring the Daleks and the Cybermen. You will save Clara, and you will do it now, or I will rain hell on you for the rest of time. 
I can do whatever the hell I like. You've read the stories. You know who I am. And in all of that time, did you ever hear anything about anyone who stopped me? 
The Doctor is no longer here! You are stuck with me. And I will end you, and everything you love. 
Now! 
I don't care. 
No, I don't. 
Do what? 
No. This, this isn't happening. This can't be happening. 
This is my fault. 
I let you get reckless. 
Clara, there's nothing special about me. I am nothing, but I'm less breakable than you. I should have taken care of you. 
You shouldn't have to ask. 
What's the point of being a Doctor if I can't cure you? 
What about me? 
Clara.
Don't run. Stay with me. 
Clara 
What Clara said about not taking revenge. Do you know why she said that? 
I was lost a long time ago. She was saving you. I'll do my best, but I strongly advise you to keep out of my way. You'll find that it's a very small universe when I'm angry with you. 
If you think because she is dead, I am weak, then you understand very little. If you were any part of killing her, and you're not afraid, then you understand nothing at all. So, for your own sake, understand this. I am the Doctor. I'm coming to find you, and I will never, ever stop. 
The equipment in that room is consistent with an augmented ultra long-range teleport. So, I'm not more than a single light year from where I was, and I'm in the same time zone. 
When the sun sets, I'll be able to establish an exact position by the stars. Then you'll have a choice. Come out, show yourself, or keep on hiding. Clara said I shouldn't take revenge. You should know, I don't always listen.
Oh, what's this? Well, are you gardeners? I hate gardening! What sort of a person has a power complex about flowers? It's dictatorship for inadequates. Or to put it another way, it's dictatorship. Come on! Chop, chop! The Doctor will see you now! Show me what you've got! I just watched my best friend die in agony. My day can't get any worse. Let's see what we can do about yours!
I know you. I've seen you before. 
I used to know a trick, back when I was young and telepathic. Clearly, you can't make an actual psychic link with a door, for one very obvious reason. They're notoriously cross. I mean, imagine life as a door. People keep pushing past you. All of that knocking, but it's never for you. And you get locked up every night, so if you're just a little bit nice.
See, Clara? Still got it. 
But I. Er,  I can't actually see a way out of this  I've finally run out of corridor. There's a life summed up. Oh, now this is new. I'm scared. I just realised that I'm actually scared of dying.
Something I said? What did I say? 
Why did you stop?
Old. Very old. Possibly very, very old.
When I was a very little boy, there was an old lady who died. (cheek pop) They covered her in veils, but it was a hot, sunny day, and the flies came. It gave me nightmares for years. So, who's been stealing my nightmares? 
What am I here for? You've known about me for a very long time, right?
So, what is it? Is it a trap? Is it a prison? No! Is it a torture chamber? Am I right? Somebody really should know better. Anyone who can put all of this together and steal my bad dreams, they should know better.
The secrets I have? No chance. No telling, not me. 
Because you won't see this coming!
Sorry I'm late. Jumped out of a window. Certain death. Don't you want to know how I survived? Go on. Ask me! No, of course I had to jump! The first rule of being interrogated is that you are the only irreplaceable person in the torture chamber. The room is yours, so work it. If they're going to threaten you with death, show them who's boss. Die faster. And you've seen me do that more often than most. Isn't that right, Clara? Rule one of dying, don't. Rule two, slow down.
You've got the rest of your life. The faster you think, the slower it will pass. Concentrate. Assume you're going to survive. Always assume that. Imagine you've already survived. There's a storm room in your mind. Lock the door and think. This is my storm room. I always imagine that I'm back in my Tardis, showing off, telling you how I escaped, making you laugh. That's what I'm doing right now. I am falling, Clara. I'm dying. And I am going to explain to you how I survived. I can't wait to hear what I say. I'm nothing without an audience. One hope. Salt. 
Thought I smelled it earlier. When I broke the window, I was sure. Salty air. This castle is standing in the sea. 
 Diving into water from a great height is no guarantee of survival. I need to know exactly how far I'm going to fall, and how fast.
Why do you think I threw the stool? (breaking glass) Fall time to impact (splash) seven seconds.
The wind resistance of the stool, the atmospheric density, (the petals falling) the strength of the local gravity. (the fall of the jeweller's glass.) Am I spoiling the magic? I work at this stuff, you know? Should hit the water in about 
Point zero two seconds. The chances of remaining conscious are 
Can't I just sleep?
Do I have to know everything?
Clara, I can't always 
It keeps coming, Clara. Wherever I go, it follows. Why? Why does it do that?
Always the teacher. What's the right question, then?
It's following me. Wherever I go, it's tracking me. Slowly though. Scary lurching. Scary. These screens, everywhere. It's showing me exactly where it is all the time, how far it's got, how near. Because it's trying to scare me. Putting its breath on my neck. That's the point. That's what it's doing. This is theatre. It's all about fear. Working hypothesis. I'm in a fully automated haunted house. A mechanical maze.
It's a killer puzzle box designed to scare me to death, and I'm trapped inside it. (laughs) Must be Christmas.
Another spade? Someone wants me to dig. What do you think, Clara? Is someone trying to give me a hint? What would you do?
Yes. Yes, of course you would. 
Which, let's be honest, is what killed you. So, someone is trying to tell me that there's something important buried in this garden. That's almost the first thing they tried to tell me. Could be a trick. Could be one of my predecessors. Because I'm not the first prisoner here, am I! All those skulls! Wonder where they all went wrong. Building this height, creature that slow, so what? An hour.
Physics of a triangle. You lose.
So? It can set traps. That's okay. I'm good at traps. 
So, where are you off to? Only one way in and one way out. Well, seeing as you're going. 
No, no. That's not right.
Well, that was another close one. Or it will have been, once I've been and gone and got myself out of it. So, how am I going to do that? Come on, teacher, ask me questions!
The truth, yes. But not any old truth, Clara. This whole place is designed to terrify me. I'm being interrogated. It's not just truth it wants. That's not enough. It's confession. I have to tell truths I've never told before. That's the only thing that stops it. You see, the problem is, Clara, there are truths that I can never tell. Not for anything. But I'm scared and I'm alone. Alone, and very, very scared.
I confess. 
I didn't leave Gallifrey because I was bored! That was a lie! It's always been a lie! 
Not enough? You want more? I was scared! I ran because I was scared! Is that what you want me to say? Is that true enough for you?
Fifty seven minutes?
Bird? What's bird got to do with it? Are there birds here?
Hello? Hello, is there someone there? Hello! 
I'm following breadcrumbs laid out for me. This is somebody's game, and I can't stop playing. A game everybody else has lost. I know how to move that wall, Clara, so long as I don't run out of confessions. But what I really want to know is 
Who's been playing about with the stars? They're all in the wrong places, for this time zone, anyway. I know I didn't time travel to get here. I can feel time travel. 
If I didn't know better, I'd say I've travelled seven thousand years into the future. But I do know better. So who moved the stars?
The Hybrid. 
Long before the Time War, the Time Lords knew it was coming, like a storm on the wind. There were many prophecies and stories, legends before the fact. One of them was about a creature called the Hybrid. Half Dalek, half Time Lord, the ultimate warrior. But whose side would it be on? Would it bring peace or destruction? Was it real, or a fantasy? I confess, I know the Hybrid is real. I know where it is, and what it is. I confess, I'm afraid.
Of course. The last square on the board. What else would it be? The Tardis. One confession away.
Azbantium. Four hundred times harder than diamond. Twenty feet thick. The way out. 
Bird?
(angry) That's when I remember! Always then. Always then. Always exactly then! I can't keep doing this, Clara! I can't! Why is it always me? Why is it never anybody else's turn?
Can't I just lose? Just this once?
I can't keep doing this. I can't! I can't always do this! It's not fair! Clara, it's just not fair! Why can't I just lose? 
But I can remember, Clara.You don't understand, I can remember it all. Every time. And you'll still be gone. Whatever I do, you still won't be there.
The Hybrid is a very dangerous secret. A very, very dangerous secret and it needs to be kept!
So I'm telling you nothing. Nothing at all. Instead, I'm going to do something far worse. (punch) Argh! I'm going to get out of here, and find whoever put me here in the first place, and whatever they're trying to do, I'm going to stop it! (punch) Argh!
But it might take me a little while, so do you want me to tell you a story? (punch) Argh! The Brothers Grimm, lovely fellas. They're on my darts team. (punch) Argh! According to them, there's this emperor and he asks this shepherd's boy, how many seconds in eternity?
People always get it wrong with Time Lords. We take forever to die. Even if we're too injured to regenerate, every cell in our bodies keeps trying. Dying properly can take days. That's why we like to die among our own kind. They know not to bury us early.
I think, in my current condition, it'll take me about a day and a half to reach the top of the tower. I think. If I'm lucky, I have a day and a half.
I have to do this, Clara. It's the only way. I have to be strong. I should have known from the very beginning. Of course. The portrait of you, the creature from my own nightmares. This place is my own bespoke torture chamber, intended for me only. And all those skulls in the water. How could there be other prisoners in my Hell? The answer, of course, is there never were any other prisoners. And the stars, they weren't in the wrong place, and I haven't time travelled. 
I've just been here a very, very long time. Every room resets. Remember I told you that? Every room reverts to its original condition. Logically, the teleporter should do the same. Teleporter. Fancy word. Just like 3D printers, really, except they break down living matter and information, and transmit it. All you have to do is add energy. The room has reset, returned to its original condition when I arrived. That means there's a copy of me still in the hard drive. Me, exactly as I was, when I first got here, seven thousand years ago. All I have to find is some energy. 
And all you need for energy is something to burn.
How long can I keep doing this, Clara? Burning the old me, to make a new one?
If you think because she's dead, I am weak, then you understand very little. If you were any part of killing her and you're not afraid, then you understand nothing at all. So, for your own sake, understand this. I'm the Doctor. I'm coming to find you, and I will never, ever stop.
If I didn't know better, I'd say I've travelled seven thousand years into the future.
Aah! How many seconds in eternity?
Aaargh!
Personally, I think that's a hell of a bird.
Go to the city. Find somebody important. Tell them I'm back. Tell them, I know what they did, and I'm on my way. And if they ask you who I am, tell them I came the long way round. 
You can probably still hear me, so just between ourselves, you've got the prophecy wrong. The Hybrid is not half Dalek. Nothing is half Dalek. The Daleks would never allow that. The Hybrid destined to conquer Gallifrey and stand in its ruins
Is me.
